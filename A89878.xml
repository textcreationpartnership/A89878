            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Aking notice of late with what impudence, and (the more is the pity) confidence, the Enemies of this Commonwealth in their publick Writings and Diſcourſes labour to undermine the dear-bought Liberties and Freedoms of the People, in their declared Intereſt of a Free-State; I thought it high time, by counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>working them, to cruſh the Cockatrice in the Egg, that ſo it might never grow to be a Bird of prey: in order thereto, I have publiſhed this following Diſcourſe to the World; that ſo the Eyes of the People being opened, they may ſee whether thoſe high and ranting Diſcourſes of perſonal Prerogative and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded Monarchy, (eſpecially <note n="*" place="margin">Inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> One lately publiſhed by Mr. <hi>Howel,</hi> that ſtruts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad with a brazen Face) or a due and
<pb facs="tcp:115267:3"/>
orderly ſucceſſion of the Supreme Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the hands of the Peoples Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives, will beſt ſecure the Liberties and Freedoms of the People from the Incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Uſurpations of Tyranny, and anſwer the true Ends of the late Wars.</p>
            <p>This Treatiſe is not intended for a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Howel</hi>'s ſaid Book, but yet may obviate that part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of which he calls, <hi>Some Reflexes upon Government:</hi> for his main deſign is not ſo much, (though that be part) to aſperſe the long Parliament, (and ſo through their ſides to wound all their Friends and Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents) as to lay a Foundation for abſolute Tyranny, upon an unbounded Monarchy: and in order thereunto, he adviſes his Highneſs to lay aſide Parliaments, (or at beſt, to make them Cyphers) and to govern the Nation <hi>Vi &amp; Armis:</hi> not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut of any Honour or reſpect he bears to his Perſon, <hi>but to bring the old Intereſt and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily into more credit and eſteem with the People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Principles and Precedents, they are purely his own: for I am confident, that the moſt conſiderate part of thoſe that did engage for the late King, are ſo far from
<pb facs="tcp:115267:3"/>
owning his Tenets, that they would rather lay aſide the Family and Intereſt of the <hi>Stuarts,</hi> and declare for a Free-State, than indure to be yoked and enſlaved by ſuch an abſolute Tyranny as he pleads for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> My reaſon is this: becauſe moſt of the Nobility and Gentry of this Nation have fair Eſtates of their own, free, without any dependence upon the Crown; and they would be as unwilling to render up their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates and Poſterities in the paw of the Lion, as the Commoners themſelves.</p>
            <p>His Precedents are as falſe as his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are bad: for proof hereof, take one (and that a main one) for all: he ſaith, That <hi>until the Reign of</hi> Henry <hi>the firſt, the Commons of</hi> England <hi>were not called to the Parliament at all, or had ſo much as a Conſent in the making of Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To prove that this is falſe, there is extant an old Latine Copy ſpeaking of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Reign of King <hi>Ethelred;</hi> which telleth us, that in it were <hi>Univerſi</hi> Anglorum <hi>Optimates</hi> Ethelredi <hi>Regis Edicto: &amp; convocata Plebis multitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine collectae Regis Edicto:</hi> A Writ of Summons for all the Lords, and for choice

                  </gap>t immediately they took it, and made
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115267:6"/>
ſure of it in their own hands, by the advice of <hi>Solon,</hi> that excellent Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver: for, as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith, There is a natural deſire of Power and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty in every man: ſo that if any have once an oportunity to ſeize, they ſeldom neglect it; and if they are told it is their due, they venture life and all to attain it.</p>
               <p>If a People once conceive they ought to be free, this conception is immediately put in practice; and they free themſelves. Their firſt care is to ſee, that their Laws; their Rights, their Deputies, their Officers, and all their Dependents, be ſetled in a ſtate of freedom. This becoms like the Apple of the eye; the leaſt grain, atome, or touch, will grieve it: it is an eſpouſed virgin; they are extreme jealous over it.</p>
               <p>Thus ſtrangely affected were the Roman people, that if any one among them (though ne'er ſo deſerving) were found to aſpire, they preſently fetch'd him down, as they did the gallant <hi>Maelius</hi> and <hi>Manlius;</hi> yea, their jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie was ſo great, that they obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

every man's looks, his very nods, his garb, and his gate, whether he walked, converſed, and lived as a friend of Freedom among his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. The ſupercilious eye, the lofty brow, and the grand paw, were accounted Monſters, and no Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Freedom; ſo that it was the ſpecial care of the wiſer Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots, to keep themſelves in a demure and humble poſture, for the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuſpicion. Hence it was, that <hi>Collatinus,</hi> one of their Freedoms Founders, and of the firſt Conſuls, living in ſome more State than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, and keeping at too great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the people, ſoon taught them to forget his former merits: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that they not onely turned him out of his Conſulſhip, but quite out of the City into Baniſhment. But his Colleague <hi>Brutus,</hi> and that wiſe Man <hi>Valerius Publicola,</hi> by taking a contrary courſe, preſerved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their reputation.

the other courted them with the Title of Majeſty, laid the Faſces, the Enſigns of Authority at their Feet, fixt all appeals at their Tribunals, and levelled the lofty Walls of his own ſtately Houſe, for fear they ſhould miſtake it for a Caſtle. Thus alſo did <hi>Menenius Agrippa, Camillus,</hi> and other eminent Men in that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular State: ſo that by theſe means they made themſelves the Darlings of the people, whilſt many others of a more Grandee-humor, ſoon loſt their Intereſt and Reputation.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee, that when a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Right is once declared to them, it is almoſt impoſſible to keep it, or take it from them.</p>
               <p>It is pity, that the people of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> being born as free as any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the World, ſhould be of ſuch a ſupple humor and inclination, to bow under the ignoble preſſures of an Arbitrary Tyranny, and ſo unapt to learn what true Freedom is. It is an ineſtimable Jewel, of more worth than your Eſtates, or your Lives: it conſiſts not in a Licenſe to do what
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115267:7"/>
you liſt, but in theſe few particulars: Firſt, in having who eſome Laws ſured to every Man's ſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Secondly, in a due and eaſie courſe of adminiſtration, as to Law and Juſtice, that the Remedies of Evil may be cheap and ſpeedy. Thirdly, in a power of altering Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Governours upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion: Fourthly, in an uninterrupted courſe of ſucceſſive Parliaments, or Aſſemblies of the People. Fifthly, in a free Election of Members to ſit in every Parliament, when Rules of Election are once eſtablished. By enjoying theſe onely, a people are ſaid to enjoy their Rights, and to be truely ſtated in a condition of ſafety and Freedom.</p>
               <p>Now if Liberty is the moſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Jewel under the Sun, then when it is once in poſſeſſion, it requires more than an ordinary art and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry to preſerve it. But the great queſtion is, Which is the ſafeſt way? whether by committing of it into the hands of a ſtanding Power, or by placing the Guardianſhip in the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115267:8"/>
hands of the People, in a conſtant ſucceſſion of their ſupreme Aſſemblys. The beſt way to determine this, is by obſervation out of Romane Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; whereby it plainly appears, that people never had any real Liberty, till they were poſſeſs'd of the power of calling and diſſolving the Supreme Aſſemblies, changing Governments, enacting and repealing Laws, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a power of chuſing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puring whom they pleaſed to this work, as often as they ſhould judge expedient, for their own well-being, and the good of the Publike. This power is ſaid to be the firſt born of that Peoples Freedom: and many a ſhrewd fit, many a pang and throw the Commonwealth had, before it could be brought forth in the world: which (<hi>Gracchus</hi> told them) was a ſore affliction from the gods, that they ſhould ſuffer ſo much for the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of their Anceſtors, who when they drave our Kings, forgat to drive out the Myſteries and inconveniences of Kingly power, which were all reſerved within the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115267:8"/>
hands of the Senate. By this means the poor people miſſing the firſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſetling their freedom, ſoon loſt it again: they were told they were a Free-ſtate; and why? becauſe (forſooth) they had no King, they had at length nev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Alas, when the <hi>Romans</hi> were at this paſs, they were juſt ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Free-ſtate as was that of <hi>Sparta,</hi> in the days of yore, where they had a Senate too, to pull down the pride of Kings; but the people were left deſtitute of power and means to pull down the pride of the Senate; by which means indeed they became free to do what they liſt, whilſt the people were confined within ſtraite<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

or Duke; but little better than ſlaves under the power of their Senate: but now in the Common-wealth of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> the caſe was far otherwiſe; where it was the care of <hi>Solon,</hi> that famous Law-giver, to place both the exerciſe &amp; intereſt of Supremacy in the hands of the people, ſo that nothing of a publick intereſt could be impoſed, but what paſſed currant by vertue of their conſent and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: he inſtituted that famous Council called the <hi>Areopagus,</hi> for the managing of State-tranſactions: but left the power of Legiſlation, or law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making, in a ſucceſſive courſe of the peoples Aſſemblies; ſo that avoiding Kingly Tyranny on the one ſide, and Senatical incroachments on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he is celebrated by all Poſterity, as the man that hath left the onely Patern of a Free-ſtate fit for all the world to follow.</p>
               <p>It is alſo to be obſerved, when Kings were driven out of <hi>Rome,</hi> though they were declared and call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Free-ſtate, et it was a long time ere they could be free indeed, in

It was neceſſary therefore that he ſhould think of ſome other courſe more plauſible, whereby to worke his own ends, and yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the love of the people; who not having been uſed to liberty, did very little underſtand it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were the more eaſily gul'd out

to wit, Faction: for, as Faction is an adhering to, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of an Intereſt, that is diſtinct from the true and declared Intereſt of State: ſo it is a matter of neceſſity, that thoſe that drive it on, muſt have time to improve their ſlights and projects, in diſguiſing their deſigns, drawing in Inſtruments and Parties, and in worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of their oppoſires.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115267:20"/>
who conſidering, that the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of perpetual Dictator was the ruine of his Father <hi>Julius,</hi> continued the Government onely for a ſet-time, and procured it to be ſetled upon himſelf but for ten yeers. But what was the effect of this continuation of Power? Even this, That as the former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractings had been the occaſions of Faction, ſo this produced a Tyranny: for, at the end of every ten yeers, he wanted no pretence to renew a leaſe of the Government; and by this means ſo played his Cards, that at length he eaſily and utterly extinguiſhed the ſmall remains of the Roman Freedom.</p>
               <p>The Obſervation then ariſing from hence, is this, that the onely way for a people to preſerve themſelves in the enjoyment of their Freedom, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void thoſe fatal inconveniences of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Tyranny, is, to maintain a due and orderly ſucceſſion of Power and Perſons. This was, and is, good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths Language; and without this Rule, it is impoſſible any Nation ſhould long ſubſiſt in a State of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.

the Juſtice, and the ſelf-denial of thoſe Governours in Free-States, is worthy of all honour and admiration, who have, or ſhall at any time as willingly reſign their Truſts, as ever they took them up; and have ſo far denied themſelves, as to prefix Limits and Bounds to their own Authority. This was it that made <hi>Brutus</hi> ſo famous in the beginning of the Romane Commonwealth.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:115267:21"/>
of a Faction: both theſe deſigns muſt lie long in fermentation, or elſe they can never gain the beloved opportunity to bring matters to perfection. The Truth of this appears likewiſe in the Story of the Romane State: for, as long as all Authority was confined within the Walls of a ſtanding Senate, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more ſtudious of their own, than the common good, in a ſhort time the Commonwealth was turned altogether into a private; inſomuch, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple became not onely incapable of any Honour and Authority; but well-nigh reduced to flat beggery. Hence it was, that ſo many Quarrels and Combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons aroſe one after another: for, the Great Ones having made uſe of their time, in drawing all to themſelves, the People were forc'd to live upon bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing; and when they could borrow no longer, they fell into a general Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and forſook the City: nor could they be pacified till all Accounts were quitted; and then, with much adoe, they were wrought upon with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence of <hi>Menenius Agrippa,</hi> with his excellent Fable of a Mutiny in a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:115267:22"/>
natural Body, among the Members a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Belly.</p>
               <p>Thus, as the firſt Inſurrection was occaſioned by the Uſury and Exactions of the Great Ones; who by their long continuance in Power, had drawn all unto themſelves: ſo the ſecond was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by the Lordlineſs of thoſe ten Perſons, who being elected to do Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, according to the Laws, made uſe of their time, onely to confirm their Power, and Greaten themſelves, by repleniſhing their own Coffers, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſing of Offices, and preferring their own Kindred and Alliances: and at length, improved Self-Intereſt ſo high, that they domineered, like abſolute Tyrants, advancing and depreſſing whom they pleaſed, without reſpect of Merit or Inſufficiency, Vice or Vertue; ſo that having ſecured all in their own Hands, they over-ruled their Fellow-Senators at pleaſure, as well as the People.</p>
               <p>Many more inſtances of After-times might be given; but theſe are ſufficient whereupon to ground this Obſervation, That as the firſt Founders of the Roman
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:115267:22"/>
Liberty did well in driving out their Kings; ſo on the other ſide, they did very ill in ſetling a ſtanding Authority within themſelves: for, by this means, lying open to the Temptations of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Profit, (which are Sails too big for any humane bulk) they were immediately ſwallowed up of Self; and taking their riſe from the opportunity of a continued Power, made uſe of the Publick onely to advance their Private, whereby they put the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth into frequent flames of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content and ſedition; which might all have been prevented, could they have denied themſelves at firſt, and ſetled the State Free indeed, (as they ought to have done) by placing an orderly ſucceſſion of ſupreme Authority in the Hands of the People.</p>

Preſſure and Oppreſſion: ſo queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the People, who are moſt ſenſible of their own Burthens, being once put into a capacity and Freedom of Acting, are the moſt likely to provide Remedies for their own Relief; they onely know where the ſhooe wrings, what Griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances are moſt heavy, and what future Fences they ſtand in need of, to ſhelter them from the injurious Aſſaults of thoſe Powers that are above them: and therefore it is but Reaſon, they ſhould ſee that none be intereſted in the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Authority, but Perſons of their own election, and ſuch as muſt in a ſhort time return again into the ſame condition with themſelves, to reap the ſame Benefit or Burthen, by the Laws enacted, that befalls the reſt of the People. Then the iſſue of ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution muſt needs be this, That no Load ſhall be laid upon any, but what is common to all, and that always by common conſent; not to ſerve the Luſts of any, but onely to ſupply the Neceſſities of their Country.</p>
               <p>But when it happens, that a ſupreme Power long continues in the Hands of

any Perſon or Perſons; they, by great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of place, being ſeated above the middle Region of the People, ſit ſecure from all windes and weathers, and from thoſe ſtorms of violence that nip and terrifie the inferiour part of the World: whereas, if by a ſucceſſive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution of Authority, they came to be degraded of their Earthly Godheads, and return into the ſame condition with other Mortals, they muſt needs be the more ſenſible and tender of what ſhall be laid upon them.

good or evil of what is done, as well as the meaneſt of the people.</p>
               <p>This without controverſie muſt needs be the moſt Noble, the moſt Juſt, and the moſt excellent way of Government in Free-States; without which, it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to common ſenſe, no Nation, can long continue in a ſtate of Freedom: as appears likewiſe by Example out of the Romane Story. For what more noble Patriots were there ever in the World, than the Romane Senators were, whilſt they were kept under by their Kings, and felt the ſame Burthens of their fury, as did the reſt of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? but afterwards being freed from the Kingly yoke, and having ſecured all power within the hands of themſelves and their poſterity, they at length fell into the ſame Abſurdities that had been before committed by their Kings; ſo that this new yoke became more into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable than the former. Nor could the people finde any Remedy, untill they procured that neceſſary Office of the Tribunes; who being inveſted with a temporary Authority by the peoples Election, remained the more ſenſible
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:115267:24"/>
of their condition, and were as Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators between the Power of the Great Ones, and the Rights of the People.</p>
               <p>What more excellent Patriot could there be than <hi>Manlius,</hi> till he became corrupted by Time and Power?

               <p>The truth of this is very obſervable in the Romane State: for, during the Vaſſalage of that People under Kings, we read not of any notable Exploits, but finde them confined within a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row compaſs, oppreſs'd at home, and ever and anon ready to be ſwallowed up by their enemies. After this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Kings was aboliſhed, you know that of Grandees in a ſtanding Senate was next erected; under which Form, they made ſhift to enlarge their bounds a little: but the moſt they could then do,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:115267:25"/>
was only to ſecure themſelves from the attempts of the baniſhed <hi>Tarquins,</hi> and thoſe petty neighbours that envied the ſmall increaſe of their Dominion. But at length, when the State was made free indeed, and the People admitted into a ſhare and intereſt in the Government, as well as the Great Ones; then it was, and never till then, that their thoughts and power began to exceed the bounds of <hi>Italy,</hi> and aſpire towards that prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Empire. For, while the road of Preferment lay plain to every man, no publike work was done, nor any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt made; but every man thought he did and conquered all for himſelf, as long as he remained valiant and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: it was not Alliance, nor Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, nor Faction, nor Riches, that could advance men; but Knowledge, Valour, and vertuous Poverty, was preferred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove them all.</p>
               <p>For the confirmation whereof, we finde in the ſame Story, how that many of their brave Patriots and Conquerors were men of the meaneſt Fortune, and of ſo rare a temper of ſpirit, that they little cared to improve them, or enrich
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:115267:26"/>
themſelves by their publike employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: ſo that when they died, they were fain to be buried at the publike charge. We finde <hi>Cincinnatus,</hi> a man of mean fortune, fetch'd from the Plough, to the dignity of a Dictator: for he had no more than four acres of land, which he tilled with his own hands. Yet ſo it happened, that when the Roman Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful with his whole Army was in great peril, being circumvented and ſtraitned by the <hi>Equuns,</hi> and the City of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf in a trembling condition; then, with one conſent, they pitch'd upon <hi>Cincinnatus,</hi> as the fitteſt man for their deliverance: and he behaved himſelf ſo well, with ſo much magnanimity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, and wiſdom, that he relieved the Conſul, routed and utterly ſubdued the Enemy, and gave as it were a new life to his Countries Liberties: which work being over, he with all willingneſs quitted his Authority, and returned to the condition of a painful private life.</p>
               <p>This Example might ſeem ſtrange, but that we know it was ordinary in that State, till it grew corrupt again: for, we read alſo, how <hi>Lucius Tarquin,</hi> (not of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:115267:26"/>
the Tyrants family) a man of mean for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, yet of great worth, was choſen General of the Horſe, and drawn to it out of the Country, in which place he ſurpaſſed all the Romane youth for gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant behaviour. Such another plain Country-fellow was <hi>Attilius Regulus,</hi> the ſcourge of <hi>Carthage</hi> in his time; of whom many eminent points of Bravery were recorded: as were alſo moſt of thoſe Heroick ſpirits that ſucceeded, down to the times of <hi>Lucius Paulus E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milius,</hi> by whoſe Conqueſts, the firſt charms and inchantments of Luxury were brought out of <hi>Aſia</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there they ſoon ſwallowed up the remainders of primitive integrity and ſimplicity. And yet it is very obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble alſo, that ſo much of the ancient ſeverity was remaining ſtill even in the time of this <hi>Paulus,</hi> the famous Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that a Silver diſh, that was part of the Spoil, being given to a ſon-in-law of his, who had fought ſtoutly in that war, it was thought a great reward; and obſerved by the Hiſtorian, to be the firſt piece of plate that ever was ſeen in the Family.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:115267:27"/>This Obſervation then ariſes from this Diſcourſe, That as <hi>Rome</hi> never thrived till it was ſetled in a Freedom of the People; ſo that Freedom was preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that Intereſt beſt advanced, when all Places of Honour and Truſt were expoſed to men of Merit, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtinction; which happineſs could never be obtained, until the people were inſtated in a capacity of preferring whom they thought worthy, by a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of electing men ſucceſſively into their Supreme Offices and Aſſemblies. So long as this Cuſtome continued, and Merit took place, the people made ſhift to keep and encreaſe their Liberties: but when it lay neglected, and the ſtream of Preferment began to run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with the favour and pleaſure of particular powerful men, then Vice and Compliance making way for Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement, the people could keep their Liberties no longer; but both their Liberties and themſelves were made the price of every man's Ambition and Luxury.</p>

                             n="The People are the beſt Keepers of their Liber∣ty, becauſe they only are concerned in the point of Liberty."/> The eighth Reaſon, why the People in their Aſſemblies are the beſt Keepers
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:115267:27"/>
of their Liberty, is, becauſe it is they onely that are concerned in the point of Liberty: for, whereas in other Forms the main Intereſt and Concernment both of Kings and Grandees, lies ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in keeping the People in utter ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance what Liberty is, or elſe in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing and pleaſing them onely with the name and ſhadow of Liberty in ſtead of the ſubſtance: ſo in Free-States the People being ſenſible of their paſt condition in former times, under the Power of Great Ones, and comparing it with the poſſibilities and enjoyments of the preſent, become immediately inſtructed, that their main Intereſt and Concernment conſiſts in Liberty; and are taught by common ſenſe, that the onely way to ſecure it from the reach of Great Ones, is, to place it in the Peoples Hands, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>adorned with all the Prerogatives and Rights of Supremacy. The Truth of it is, the Intereſt of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is a Virgin that every one ſeeks to deflower; and like a Virgin, it muſt be kept from any other Form, or elſe (ſo great is the Luſt of mankinde after do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion) there follows a rape upon the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115267:28"/>
firſt opportunity. This being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, it-will eaſily be granted, That Liberty muſt needs lie more ſecure in the Peoples than in any others hands, becauſe they are moſt concerned in it: and the careful eyeing of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, is that which makes them both jealous and zealous; ſo that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will ſatisfie, but the keeping of a conſtant Guard againſt the Attempts and Inchroachments of any powerful or crafty Underminers.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that the People having once taſted the Sweets of Freedom, are ſo extreamly affected with it, that if they diſcover, or do but ſuſpect the leaſt Deſign to incroach upon it, they count it a Crime never to be forgiven for any conſideration whatſoever. Thus it was in the Romane State, where one gave up his Children, another his Brother to death, to revenge an Attempt againſt common Liberty: di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers alſo ſacrificed their Lives, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it; and ſome their beſt Friends, to vindicate it, upon bare ſuſpicion; as in the Caſes of <hi>Maelius,</hi> and <hi>Manli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and others, after manifeſt viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115267:28"/>
as in the Caſe of <hi>Caeſar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor was it thus onely in <hi>Rome;</hi> but we finde alſo as notable inſtances of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge in the Free-People of <hi>Greece,</hi> upon the ſame occaſion. But the moſt notable of all, is that which happened in the Iſland of <hi>Corcyra,</hi> during the war of <hi>Peloponneſus:</hi> where the People having been rook'd of Liberty by the ſlights and power of the Grandees, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by the aſſiſtance of the Free-ſtates of <hi>Athens</hi> recovering it again, took occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thereupon to clap up all the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees, &amp; chop'd off ten of their Heads at one time, in part of ſatisfaction for the Injury: but yet this would not ſerve the turn; for, ſome delay being made in executing of the reſt, the People grew ſo inraged, that they ran, and pull'd down the very Walls, and buried them in the ruines and rubbiſh of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>We ſee it alſo in the Free-State of <hi>Florence,</hi> where <hi>Coſmus</hi> the firſt Founder of the <hi>Tuſcan</hi>-Tyranny, having made ſhipwrack of their Liberty, and ſeized all into his own Hands; though he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved their Bodies, yet he could not
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:115267:29"/>
ſubdue their Hearts, nor wear their paſt Liberty our of Memory; for upon the firſt oportunity, they ſought re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and a recovery; forcing him to fly for the ſafety of his Life: and though afterwards he made way for his Return and Re-eſtabliſhment by Treachery, yet now after ſo long a time, the old Freedom is freſh in memory, and would ſhew it ſelf again upon a favourable oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
               <p>But of all Modern Inſtances, the moſt ſtrange is that of the Land of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein;</hi> which being deprived of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and about ſeventy yeers ſince made a Dutchy, and an Appendix to the Crown of <hi>Denmark;</hi> though the Inhabitants be but a Booriſh, poor, ſilly Generation, yet ſtill they retain a ſenſe of Indignation at the loſs of their Liberty; and being given to drink, the uſual Complement in the midſt of their Cups, is this, <hi>Here is a health to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of our Liberty.</hi>

                             n="The Go∣vernment of a Free State is leſs Lu∣xurious, than Kings or Grandees"/> The ninth Reaſon to juſtifie a Free-State, is, becauſe in Free-States the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are leſs Luxurious, than Kings or Grandees uſe to be. Now, this is moſt certain, that where Luxury takes place, there is as natural a tendency to Tyranny, as there is from the Cauſe to the Effect: for, you know the Nature of Luxury lies altogether in Exceſs. It is a Univerſal Depravation of Manners, without Reaſon, without Moderation; it is the Canine appetite of a corrupt Will and Phant'ſie, which nothing can ſatisfie; but in every Action, in every Imagination, it flies beyond the Bounds of Honeſty, Juſt, and Good, into all Extremity: ſo that it will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be granted, That Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt needs be the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and the Peoples Liberty moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, where Governours are leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the baits and ſnares of Luxury.</p>
               <p>The evidence of this may be made out, not onely by Reaſon, but by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:115267:30"/>
old and new. And firſt, by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it is evident, That the People muſt needs be leſs luxurious than Kings or the Great Ones, becauſe they are bounded within a more lowly pitch of Deſire and Imagination: give them but <hi>panem &amp; tircenſes;</hi> Bread, Sport and Eaſe, and they are abundantly ſatisfied. Beſides, the People have leſs means and opportunities for Luxury, than thoſe pompous ſtanding powers, whether in the hands of one or many: ſo that were they never ſo much inclined to Vice or Vanity, yet they are not able to run on to the ſame meaſure of Exceſs and Riot. Secondly, as it appears they are leſs Luxurious; ſo, for this Cauſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, it is cleer, They (that is, their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Repreſentatives) muſt be the beſt Governours; not onely, becauſe the current of ſucceſſion keeps them the leſs corrupt and preſumptious; but alſo, becauſe, being the more free from luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Courſes, they are likewiſe free from thoſe oppreſſive and injurious Practices, which Kings and Grandees are moſt commonly led and forced unto, to hold up the port and ſplendor of their Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:115267:30"/>
and to ſatisfie thoſe natural appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites of Covetouſneſs, Pride, Ambition and Oſtentation, which are the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Attendants of Great Ones, and Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xury. Thus much for Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Now, for Example, we might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a Cloud of Inſtances, to ſhew<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That Free-States, or the People duely qualified with the Supreme Authority, are leſs devoted to Luxury, than the Grandee or Kingly Powers: but we ſhall give you onely a few,</p>
               <p>The firſt that comes in our way is the State of <hi>Athens,</hi> which, whilſt it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained free in the Peoples Hands, was adorned with ſuch Governours as gave themſelves up to a ſerious, abſtemious, ſevere courſe of Life; ſo that whilſt Temperance and Liberty walked hand in hand, they improved the points of Valour and Prudence ſo high, that in a ſhort time they became the onely Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrators of all Affairs in <hi>Greece.</hi> But being at the height, then (after the common fate of all worldly Powers) they began to decline; for, (contrary to the Rules of a Free-State) permitting ſome men to greaten themſelves, by
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:115267:31"/>
continuing long in Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, they ſoon loſt their pure Principles of Severity and Libertie: for, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarted thoſe thirty Grandees, (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the Tyrants) who having uſurped a ſtanding Authority unto themſelves, preſently quitted the old Diſcipline and Freedom, gave up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves firſt to Charms of Luxury, and afterwards to all the practices of an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Tyranny. Such alſo was the condition of that State, when at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time (as in the dayes of <hi>Piſtratus</hi>) it was uſurp'd in the hands of a ſingle Tyrant.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Athens</hi> let us paſs to <hi>Rome,</hi> where we finde it in the dayes of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin,</hi> diſſolved into Debauchery. Upon the change of Government, their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were ſomewhat mended, as were the Governours in the Senate: but that being a ſtanding Power, ſoon grew corrupt; and firſt let in Luxury, then Tyranny, till the people being intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Government, eſtabliſhed a good Diſcipline and Freedom both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; which was upheld with all Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, till the ten Grandees came in
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115267:31"/>
play after; whoſe Depoſition, Liberty, and Sobriety began to breath again, till the dayes of <hi>Sylla, Marius,</hi> and other Grandees that followed down to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> in whoſe time Luxury and Tyranny grew to ſuch a height, that unleſs it were in the Life and Converſation of <hi>Cato,</hi> there was not ſo much as one ſpark, that could be raked out of the aſhes, of the old Roman Diſcipline and Freedom; ſo that of all the World, onely <hi>Cato</hi> remained as a Monument of that Temperance, Virtue and Freedom, which flouriſhed under the Government of the People.</p>
               <p>Omitting many other Examples, our Concluſion upon theſe Particulars ſhall be this, That ſince the Grandee or Kingly Powers, are ever more luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, than the popular are, or can be: and ſince Luxury ever brings on Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as the onely bane of Liberty; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Rights and Priviledges of the People, placed and provided for, in a due and orderly ſucceſſion of their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Aſſemblies, muſt needs remain more ſecure in their own Hands, than in any others whatſoever.</p>

And this ariſes from that apprehenſion which every particular Man hath of his own immediate ſhare in the publick Intereſt, as well as of that ſecurity which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he poſſeſſes in the enjoyment of his private Fortune, free from the reach of any Arbitrary Power. Hence it is, that whenſoever any good ſucceſs or happineſs betides the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, every one counts i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> his own: if the Commonwealth conquer, thrive in Dominion, Wealth or Honour, he reckons all done for himſelf; if he ſees Diſtributions of Honour, high Offices, or great Rewards, to Valiant, Vertuous, or Learned Perſons, he eſteems them as his own, as long as he hath a door left open to ſucceed in the ſame Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Enjoyments, if he can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto the ſame meaſure of Deſert.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:115267:32"/>
This it is which makes men aſpire unto great Actions, when the Reward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends not upon the Will and Pleaſure of particular Perſons, as it doth under all ſtanding Powers; but is conferred upon Men (without any conſideration of Birth or Fortune) according to merit, as it ever is, and ought to be in Free-States, that are rightly conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>The Truth of this will appear much more evident, if ye liſt a little to take a view of the condition of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, under various Forms of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for, the Romanes of old, while under Kings, (as you heard before) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained a very inconſiderable People, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Dominion or Reputation; and could never inlarge their Command very far beyond the Walls of their City. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, being reduced unto that ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power of the Senate, they began to thrive a little better, &amp;, for a little time: yet all they could do, was only to ſtruggle that for a ſubſiſtence among bad Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. But at length, when the People began to know, claim, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs their Liberties in being govern'd
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:115267:33"/>
by a ſuceſſion of their Supreme Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Aſſemblies; then it was, and never till then, that they laid the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and built the Structure of that wondrous Empire that overſhadowed the whole World. And truely the founding of it muſt needs be more wonderful, and a great Argument of an extraordinary Courage and Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, wherewith the People was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued in Recovery of Liberty; becauſe their firſt Conqueſts were laid in the ruine of mighty Nations, and ſuch as were every jot as free as themſelves: which made the difficulties-ſo much the more, by how much the more free (and conſequently, the more couragious) they were, againſt whom they made oppoſition: for as in thoſe dayes the World abounded with Free-States, more than any other Form, as all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Italy, Gallia, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> &amp;c. ſo ſpecially in <hi>Italy,</hi> where the <hi>Tuſcans,</hi> the <hi>Samnites,</hi> and other Emulators and Competitors of the Romane Freedom, approved themſelves magnanimous Defenders of their Liberty againſt <hi>Rome,</hi> that they endured Wars ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:115267:33"/>
yeers with utmoſt extremity, before ever they could brought to bow under the Romane Yoke. This magnanimous State of Freedom, was the cauſe alſo why <hi>Charthage</hi> was enabled ſo long, not only to oppoſe, but often to hazard the Romane Fortune, and uſurp the Laurel. It brought <hi>Hannibal</hi> within view, and the <hi>Gauls</hi> within the Walls of the City, to a beſieging of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitol; to ſhew, that their Freedom had given them the courage to rob her of her Maiden-head, who afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Miſtriſs of the whole World. But what ſerves all this for, but onely to ſhew, That as nothing but a State of Freedom could have enabled thoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with a Courage ſufficient ſo long to withſtand the Romane Power: ſo <hi>Rome</hi> her ſelf alſo was beholden to this State of Freedom, for thoſe Sons of Courage which brought the Necks of her Siſter-States and Nations under her Girdle? And it is obſervable alſo in after-times, when Tyranny took place againſt Liberty, the Romans ſoon loſt their ancient Courage and Magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; firſt under uſurping Dictators, then

                             n="No deter∣minations are carried but by con∣ſent of the People."/> The eleventh Reaſon is, becauſe in this Form no Determinations being carried, but by conſent of the People; therefore they muſt needs remain ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure out of the reach of Tyranny, and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:115267:34"/>
free from the Arbitrary Diſpoſition of any commanding Power. In this Caſe, as the People know what Laws they are to obey, and what Penalties they are to undergo, in caſe of Tranſgreſſion; ſo having their ſhare and intereſt in the making of Laws, with the Penalties annexed, they become the more inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable if they offend, and the more willingly ſubmit unto puniſhment when they ſuffer for any offence. Now the caſe is uſually far otherwiſe, under all ſtanding Powers: for, when Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is managed in the hands of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſon, or continued in the hands of a certain number of Great Men, the People then have no Laws but what Kings and Great Men pleaſe to give: Not do they know how to walk by thoſe Laws, or how to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them, becauſe the ſenſe is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times left at uncertainty; and it is reckoned a great Myſtery of State in thoſe Forms of Government, That no Laws ſhall be of any ſenſe or ſorce, but as the Great Ones pleaſe to expound them: ſo as by this means, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple many times are left as it were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:115267:35"/>
Law, becauſe they bear no other conſtruction and meaning, but what ſutes with particular mens Intereſts and Phant'ſies; not with Right Reaſon, or the Publike Liberty.</p>
               <p>For the proof of this under Kingly Government, we might run all the world over; but our own Nation affords Inſtances enough in the Practices of all our Kings: yet this Evil never came to ſuch a height, as it did in the Raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, who by uſurping a Prerogative of expounding the Laws after his own pleaſure, made them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Snares, than Inſtruments of Relief, (like a grand Catch-pole) to pill, poll, and geld the Purſes of the People; as his Son <hi>Harry</hi> did after him, to deprive many Gallant Men both of their Lives and Fortunes. For, the Judges being reputed the Oracles of the Law, and the power of creating Judges being u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurp'd by Kings, they had a care ever to create ſuch, as would make the Laws ſpeak in Favour of them, upon any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. The Truth whereof hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly appeared in the dayes of the late King, and his Father <hi>James,</hi> whoſe
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:115267:35"/>
uſual Language was this: <hi>As long as I have power of making what Judges and Biſhops I pleaſe, I am ſure to have no Law nor Goſpel but what ſhall pleaſe me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This very providing for this Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, was the great Commendation of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> his Inſtitution in <hi>Sparta;</hi> who, though he cut out the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Commonwealth after the Grandee faſhion, confirming the Supremacy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Walls of the Senate, (for their King was but a Cypher) yet he ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the matter, that he took away the Grandeur; that as their King was of little more value than any one of the Senators; ſo the Senate was reſtrained by Laws, walking in the ſame even pace of ſubjection with the People; having very few Offices of Dignity or Profit allowed, which might make them ſwell with State and Ambition; but were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed alſo the ſame Rules of Frugality, Plainneſs, and Moderation, as were the Common People: by which means immoderate luſts and deſires being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented in the Great Ones, they were the leſs inclined to Pride and Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and no great profit or pleaſure
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:115267:36"/>
being to be gotten by Authority, very few deſired it; and ſuch as were in it, ſate free from Envie, by which means they avoided that odium and emulation which uſes to rage betwixt the Great Ones and the People in that Form of Government.</p>
               <p>But now the caſe is far otherwiſe in the Commonwealth of <hi>Venice,</hi> where the People being excluded from all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Government, the power of making and executing of Laws, and bearing of Offices, with all other Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, lies onely in the hands of a ſtanding Senate, and their Kindred, which they call the <hi>Patrocian,</hi> or Noble Order. Their Duke, or Prince, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed reſtrained, and made juſt ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Officer as were the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Kings; differing from the reſt of the Senate, onely in a Corner of his Cap, beſides a little outward Ceremony and Splendor: but the Senators them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have Liberty at random, Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to ramble, and do what they pleaſe with the people: who excepting the City it ſelf, are ſo extreamly oppreſs'd in all their Territories, living by no
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:115267:36"/>
Law, but the Arbitrary Dictates of the Senate, that it ſeems rather a Junta, than a Commonwealth; and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects take ſo little content in it, that ſeeing more to be enjoyed under the Turk, they that are his Borderers take all opportunities to revolt, and ſubmit rather to the mercy of a Pagan-Tyranny. Which diſpoſition if you conſider, together with the little Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in their Subjects, by reaſon they preſs them ſo hard; and how that they are forced, for this cauſe, to relie upon Forrain Mercenaries in all warlike Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions, you might wonder how this State hath held up ſo long; but that we know the Intereſt of Chriſtendom, being concerned in her Security, ſhe hath been chiefly ſupported by the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies and Arms of others.</p>
               <p>Therefore our Concluſion ſhall be this, That ſince Kings, and all ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Powers, are ſo inclinable to act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own Wills and in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, in making, expounding, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting of Laws to the prejudice of the Peoples Liberty and Security: and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the onely way to prevent Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riness
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:115267:37"/>
is, That no Laws or Domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions whatſoever ſhould be made, but by the Peoples Conſent and Election: therefore it muſt of neceſſity be granted, that the People are the beſt Keepers of their own Liberties, being ſetled in a due and orderly ſucceſſion of their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Aſſemblies.</p>

                             n="A Free-State is moſt ſutable to the Na∣ture and Reaſon of mankinde."/> A twelfth Reaſon is, becauſe this Form is moſt ſutable to the Nature and Reaſon of Mankinde: for, as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith, <hi>Man is a noble Creature, born with Affections to rule, rather than obey; there being in every man a natural appetite or deſire of Principality.</hi> And therefore the Reaſon why one man is content to ſubmit to the Government of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is, not becauſe he conceives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to have leſs right than another to govern; but either becauſe he findes himſelf leſs able, or elſe becauſe he judgeth it will be more convenient for himſelf, and that community whereof he is a Member, if he ſubmits unto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother's Government. <hi>Nemini purere vult animús a naturâ bene informatus, niſi,</hi> &amp;c. ſaith the ſame <hi>Cicero:</hi> that is to ſay, in honeſt Engliſh, <hi>A minde well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:115267:37"/>
by the light of Nature, will pay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience unto none, but ſuch as command, direct, or govern, for its good and benefit.</hi> From both which paſſages and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of that Oracle of Humane wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, theſe three inferences do natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ariſe: Firſt, that by the light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture people are taught to be their own Carvers and Contrivers, in the framing of that Government under which they mean to live. Secondly, that none are to preſide in Government, or ſit at the Helm, but ſuch as ſhall be judged fit, and choſen by the People. Thirdly, that the People are the onely proper Judges of the convenience or inconvenience of a Government when it is erected, and of the behaviour of Governours after they are choſen: which three Deductions appear to be no more, but an Explanation of this moſt excellent Maxime, That the Original and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all juſt Power and Government is in the People.</p>
               <p>This being ſo, that a Free-State-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by the People, that is, by their ſucceſſive Repreſentatives, or ſupreme Aſſemblies, duely choſen, is moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:115267:38"/>
and onely ſutable to the Reaſon of mankinde: then it follows, that the other forms, whether it be of a ſtanding Power in the Hands of a particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as a King; or of a ſet number of Great Ones, as in a Senate, are beſides the Dictates of Nature, being meer ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial devices of Great Men, ſquared out onely to ſerve the Ends and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of Avarice, Pride and Ambition of a few, to a vaſſalizing of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity. The Truth whereof appears ſo much the more, if we conſider, That a Conſent and free Election of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which is the moſt natural Way and Form of governing, hath no real effect in the other Forms; but is either ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted by Craft and Cuſtome, or ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up by a pernicious pretence of Right (in one or many) to govern, onely by vertue of an Hereditary ſucceſſion. Now certainly, were there no other Argument to prove the excellency of Government by the People, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> beyond the other Forms; yet this one might ſuffice, That in the Peoples Form, men have Liberty to make uſe of that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Underſtanding God hath given
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:115267:38"/>
them, in chuſing of Governours, and providing for their own ſafety in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: but in the other Forms of a ſtanding Power, all Authority being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed to certain Perſons and Families, in a courſe of inheritance, men are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes deprived of the uſe of their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon about choice of Governours, and forced to receive them blindely, and at all adventure: which courſe being ſo deſtructive to the Reaſon, common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and Majeſty of that Noble Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, called Man, that he ſhould not in a matter of ſo high conſequence as Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, (wherein the good and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all is concerned) have a Freedom of Choice and Judgement, muſt needs be the moſt irrational and brutiſh Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in the World, and fit onely to be hiſſed out of the World, together with all Forms of ſtanding Power (whether in Kings, or others) which have ſerved for no other end, but transform Men into Beaſts, and mortified man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde with miſery through all Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
               <p>The Truth of this is evident all the World over; firſt, by ſad Examples of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:115267:39"/>
Monarchy: for, the Kingly form having been retained in a courſe of Inheritance, men being forced to take what comes next for a Governour, whether it be Male or Female, a wiſe Man or a Fool, Good or Bad; ſo that the major part of Hereditary Princes, have been Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannous and Wicked by Nature, or made ſo by Education and Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: the People have been for the moſt part banded to and fro, with their Lives and Fortunes, at the Will and Pleaſure of ſome one ſingle unworthy Fellow, who uſually aſſumes the greater confidence in his unrighteous dealing, becauſe he knows the People are tied in that Form to him and his, though he practice all the Injuſtice in the World. This was it that brought on Tyranny in <hi>Rome,</hi> firſt under their Kings, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards under Emperors: for it is to be obſerved out of the Story, that all thoſe Emperors which ruled by right of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, proved moſt of them no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than ſavage Beaſts, and all of them Wicked except <hi>Titus.</hi> 'Tis true indeed, That a Nation may have ſome reſpite and recruit now and then, by the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:115267:39"/>
and Valour of a ſingle Prince; yet this is very rare; and when it doth hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, it uſually laſts no longer than for his Life, becauſe his Son or Succeſſor (for the moſt part) proves more weak or vitious, than himſelf was Virtuous, as you may ſee in the ſeveral Liſts of Kings throughout <hi>Great Britain, France, Spain,</hi> and all the World. But this is not all the Inconvenience, that Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Princes have been and are for the moſt part Wicked in their own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: for, as great Inconveniences hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen by their being litigious in their Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles; witneſs the bloody diſputes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Princes of the Blood in <hi>France,</hi> as alſo in <hi>England,</hi> between the two Houſes of <hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter;</hi> to which many more might be reckoned out of all other Kingdoms; which mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, the people might have avoided, had they not been tied to one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Line of Succeſſion. Therefore if any Kingly Form be tolerable, it muſt be that which is by Election, choſen by the Peoples Repreſentatives, and made an Officer of Truſt by them, to whom they are to be accountable. And
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:115267:40"/>
herein, as Kings are onely tolerable upon this account, as Elective; ſo theſe Elective Kings are as intolerable upon another account, becauſe their preſent Greatneſs gives them opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ever to practiſe ſuch flights, that in a ſhort time, the Government that they received onely for their own Lives, will become entailed upon their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, whereby the Peoples Election will be made of no effect further, than for Faſhion, to mock the poor People, and adorn the Triumphs of an aſpiring Tyranny; as it hath been ſeen in the Elective Kingdoms of <hi>Bohemia, Poland, Hungaria,</hi> and <hi>Sweden;</hi> where the Forms of Election were, and are ſtill retained; but the Power ſwallowed up, and the Kingdoms made Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary; not onely in <hi>Sweden,</hi> by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice of <hi>Gustavus Ericus;</hi> but alſo in <hi>Poland,</hi> and the Empire, where the peoples right of election was ſoon eaten out by the cunning of the two Families of <hi>Caſimira</hi> and <hi>Austria.</hi>

               <p>Let this ſerve to manifeſt, that a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by a free Election and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the People, ſetled in a due and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:115267:40"/>
orderly ſucceſſion of their ſupreme Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, is more conſonant to the light of Nature and Reaſon, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly much more excellent than any Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary ſtanding Power whatſoever.

                             n="In this Go∣vernment there are fewer opor∣tunities of Oppreſſion and Tyran∣ny, then un∣der any o∣ther Form."/> The thirteenth Reaſon, to prove the excellency of a Free-State above any other Form, is, becauſe in Free-States there are fewer opportunities of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and Tyranny, than in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Forms. And this appears, in that it is ever the care of Free-Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, for the moſt part, to preſerve, not an Equality, (which were irrational and odious) but an Equability of Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among all the Members; ſo that no particular Man or Men ſhall be permitted to grow over-great in Power; nor any Rank of Men be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:115267:41"/>
above the ordinary Standard, to aſſume unto themſelves the State and Title of Nobility.</p>
               <p>The Obſervation of the former, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures the Peoples Liberty from the reach of their own Officers, ſuch as being entruſted with the Affairs of high Truſt and Imployment, either in Campe and Council, might perhaps take occaſion thereby to aſpire beyond Reaſon, if not reſtrained and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</p>
               <p>The Obſervation of the later, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures the People from the preſſures and Ambition of ſuch perty Tyrants, as would uſurp and claim a Prerogative, Power, and Greatneſs above others, by Birth and Inheritance. Theſe are a ſort of Men not to be endured in any well-ordered Commonwealth; for they alwayes bear a Natural and Implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Hate towards the People, making it their Intereſt to deprive them of their Liberty; ſo that if at any time it happen, that any great Man or Men whatſoever, arrive to ſo much Power and Confidence, as to think of uſurping, or to be in a Condition
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:115267:41"/>
to be tempted thereunto; theſe are the firſt that will ſet them on, mingle In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts with them, and become the prime Inſtruments in heaving them up into the Seat of Tyranny.</p>
               <p>For the clearing of theſe Truths; and firſt, to manifeſt the Inconvenience of permitting any perſons to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>great in any State; and that Free-States that have not avoided it, have ſoon loſt their Liberty, we ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a File of Examples. In <hi>Greece</hi> we finde, that the Free-State of <hi>Athens</hi> loſt its Liberty upon that account once, when they ſuffered certain of the Senators to over-top the reſt in power; which occaſioned that multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Tyranny, made famous by the name of the thirty Tyrants: at another time, when by the ſame Error they were conſtrained, through the power of <hi>Pistr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tus,</hi> to ſtoop unto his ſingle Tyranny.</p>
               <p>Upon this ſcore alſo, the people of <hi>Syracuſa</hi> had the ſame misfortune un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Tyrant <hi>Hiero,</hi> as had they of <hi>Sicily</hi> under <hi>Dyonlſius</hi> and <hi>Agatho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:115267:42"/>In <hi>Rome</hi> alſo the caſe is the ſame too: for during the time that Liberty was included within the Senate, they gave both <hi>Malius</hi> &amp; <hi>Manlius</hi> an opportunity to aſpire, by permitting them a growth of too much Greatneſs: but by good fortune eſcaping their clutches, they afterwards fell as fooliſhly into the hands of ten of their Fellow-Senators, called the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemviri,</hi> in giving them ſo much power as tempted them unto Tyranny. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, when the people ſcuffled, and made a ſhift to recover their Liberty out of the hands of the Senate, they committed the ſame Error too, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of their Servants to grow over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>great; ſuch as <hi>Sylla,</hi> who by power ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannized and made himſelf Dictator for five yeers, as <hi>Caeſar</hi> afterwards ſecled the Dictatorſhip upon himſelf for ever: and after <hi>Caeſar's</hi> death, they might have recovered their Liberty again, if they had taken care (as they might eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have done) to prevent the growing Greatneſs of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> who gaining power firſt, by the courteſie &amp; good will of the Senate and People, made uſe of it to eſtabliſh himſelf in a Tyranny, which
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:115267:42"/>
could never after be extinguiſhed, but in the ruine of the Roman Empire it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Thus alſo the Free-State of <hi>Florence</hi> fooliſhly ruined it ſelf by the greatning of <hi>Coſmus;</hi> firſt, permitting him to ingroſs the Power, which gave him opportunity to be a tyrant; &amp; then as fooliſhly forcing him to declare himſelf a Tyrant, by an unſeaſonable demand of the power back out of his hands. Many more inſtances might be fetch'd out of <hi>Milan, Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and other places: but we have one neerer home, and of a later date, in <hi>Holland;</hi> whereby, permitting the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of <hi>Orange</hi> to greaten a little more than beſeemed a Member of a Free-State, they were inſenſibly reduced to the laſt caſt, to run the hazzard of the loſs of their Liberty.</p>
               <p>Therefore one prime Principle of State, is, To keep any man, though he have deſerved never ſo well by good ſucceſs or ſervice, from being too great or popular: it is a notable means (and ſo eſteemed by all Free-States) to keep and preſerve a Commonwealth from the Rapes of Uſurpation.</p>

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:115267:43"/>
the laſt, yet not the leaſt) to prove a Free-State or Government by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſetled in a due and orderly ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their ſupreme Aſſemblies, is much more excellent than any other Form, is, becauſe in this Form, all Powers are accountable for miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanors in Government, in regard of the nimble Returns and Periods of the Peoples Election: by which means, he that ere-while was a Governour, being reduced to the condition of a Subject, lies open to the force of the Laws, and may with eaſe be brought to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for his offence; ſo that after the obſervation of ſuch a courſe, others which ſucceed, will become the leſs daring to offend, or to abuſe their Truſt in Authority, to an oppreſſion of the People. Such a courſe as this, cuts the very throat of all Tyranny; and doth not onely root it up when at full growth, but cruſheth the Cockatrice in the Egg, deſtroys it in the Seed, in the principal, and in the very poſſibli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of its being for ever after. And as the ſafety of the People, is the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign and Supreme Law; ſo an eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:115267:43"/>
of this Nature, is an impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Bulwark of the Peoples ſafety, becauſe without it, no certain Benefit can be obtained by the ordinary Laws; which if they ſhould be diſpenſed by uncontrolable, unaccountable Perſons in Power, ſhall never be interpreted, but in their own ſenſe; nor executed, but after their own Wills and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               <p>Now, this is moſt certain, That as in the Government of the People, the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Revolution of Authority by their conſent, hath ever been the onely Bank againſt Inundations of Arbitrary Power and Tyranny; ſo on the other ſide, it is as ſure, That all ſtanding Powers have and ever do aſſume unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves an Arbitrary Exerciſe of their own dictates at pleaſure, and make it their onely Intereſt to ſettle themſelves in an unaccountable ſtate of Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: ſo that, though they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit all the injuſtice in the World, their cuſtome hath been ſtill to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men, partly by ſtrong pretence of Argument, and partly by force, that they may do what they liſt, and that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:115267:44"/>
they are not bound to give an account of their Actions to any, but to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. This Doctrine of Tyranny hath taken the deeper Root in mens mindes, becauſe the greateſt part was ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to adore the Golden Idol of Tyranny in every Form: by which means the rabble of mankinde being prejudicated in this particular, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving plac'd their corrupt humour or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in baſe fawning, and the favour of preſent Great Ones; Therefore if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reſolute Spirit happen to broach and maintain true Principles of Freedom, or do at any time ariſe to ſo much courage, as to perform a noble Act of Juſtice, in calling Tyrants to an account, preſently he draws all the enmity and fury of the World about him. But in Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths it is and ought to be otherwiſe; for, in the Monuments of the Grecian and Romane Freedom, we finde, thoſe Nations were wont to heap all the Honours they could invent, by publick Rewards, Conſecration of Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and Crowns of Laurel, upon ſuch worthy Patriots: and as if on earth all were too little, they inroll'd them

And all this they did out of a Noble ſenſe of Commonweal-intereſt; knowing that the life of Liberty conſiſts in a ſtrict hand, and zeal againſt Tyrants and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, and by keeping perſons in power from all the occaſions of it: which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be better done, than (according to the cuſtom of all States that are really free) by leaving them liable to account: which happineſs was never ſeen yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſun, by any Law or Cuſtom eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, ſave onely in thoſe States, where all men are brought to taſte of Subjection as well as Rule, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſetled by a due ſucceſſion of Authority, by conſent of the People.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Switzerland</hi> the people are free indeed, becauſe all Officers and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours in the Cantons, are queſtionable by the People in their ſucceſſive Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.</p>
               <p>The Inference from the fore-going particulars, is eaſie, That ſince Freedom is to be preſerved no other way in a Commonwealth, but by keeping Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Governours in an accountable ſtate; and ſince it appears no ſtanding
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:115267:45"/>
Powers can never be called to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count without much difficulty, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving a Nation in Blood or Miſery.

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:115267:47"/>
to prevent a return of the Intereſt of Monarchy: for no Perſon or Parties ſeeking or ſetting up a private Intereſt of their own, diſtinct from the Publick, it will ſtop the Mouths of all Gain-ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. But the Truth is, This way of Free-State, or Government by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in their ſucceſſive Aſſemblies, is ſo far from introducing a community, that it is the onely preſervative of Propriety in every particular: the Reaſons where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are plain: for, as on the one ſide, it is not in Reaſon to be imagined, that ſo choice a Body, as the Repreſentative of a Nation, ſhould agree to deſtroy one another in their ſeveral Rights and Intereſts: on the other ſide, all Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations being carried in this Form by common Conſent, every Man's particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Intereſt muſt needs be fairly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for, againſt the Arbitrary diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of others; therefore, whatever is contrary to this, is levelling indeed; becauſe it placeth every Man's Right under the Will of another, and is no leſs than Tyranny; which ſeating it ſelf in an unlimited uncontrollable Prerogative over others without their

Conſent, becomes the very bane of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety; and however diſquieted, or in what Form ſoever it appears, is indeed the very Intereſt of Monarchy.</p>
               <p>Now that a Free-State, or ſucceſſive Government of the People, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> is the onely preſervative of Propriety, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by Inſtances all the World over; yet we ſhall cite but a few.</p>
               <p>Under Monarchs, we ſhall finde ever, That the Subjects had nothing that they could call their own; neither Lives, nor Fortunes, nor Wives, nor any thing elſe that the Monarch pleaſed to command, becauſe the poor people knew no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt the levelling Will of an unbounded Soveraignity; as may be ſeen in the Records of all Nations that have ſtoop'd under that wretched Form: whereof we have alſo very ſad Examples in <hi>France,</hi> and other Kingdoms, at this very day, where the People have nothing of Propriety; but all depends upon the Royal Pleaſure, as it did of late <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ere in <hi>England.</hi> Moreover, it is very obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, That in Kingdoms where the People have enjoyed any thing of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and Propriety, they have been
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:115267:48"/>
ſuch Kingdoms onely, where the frame of Government hath been ſo well tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, as that the beſt ſhare of it hath been retained in the Peoples Hands; and by how much the greater influence the People have had therein, ſo much the more ſure and certain they have been, in the enjoyment of their Propriety.</p>
               <p>To paſs by many other Inſtances, conſider how firm the <hi>Aragonians</hi> were in their Liberties and Properties, ſo long as they held their hold over their Kings in their ſupreme Aſſemblies; and no ſooner had <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived them of their ſhare in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but themſelves and their properties became a prey (and have been ever ſince) to the Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of their Kings.</p>
               <p>The like alſo may be ſaid of <hi>Erance,</hi> where, as long as the Peoples Intereſt bore ſway in their ſupreme Aſſemblies, they could call their Lives and Fortunes their own, and no longer: for, all that have ſucceeded ſince <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh, followed his levelling pattern ſo far, that in ſhort time they deſtroyed the Peoples Property, and became the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:115267:48"/>
greateſt Levellers in Chriſtendom. We were almoſt at the ſame paſs here in <hi>England:</hi> for, as long as the Peoples Intereſt was preſerved by frequent and ſucceſſive Parliaments; ſo long we were in ſome meaſure ſecure of our Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: but as Kings began to worm the People out of their ſhare in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by diſcontinuing of Parliaments; So they carried on their levelling de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, to the deſtroying of our Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and had by this means brought it ſo high, that the Oracles of the Law and Goſpel ſpake it out with a good level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Grace, That <hi>all was the King's and that we had nothing we might call our own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you ſee how much Levelling, and little of Propriety, the people h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Nor hath it been thus onely under Kings; but we finde, the People have ever had as little of Property ſecure, under all other Forms of ſtanding Powers; which have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced as errant Levellers in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, as any of the Monarchies. In the

Free-State of <hi>Athens,</hi> as long as the People kept free indeed, in an enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their ſucceſſive Aſſemblies, ſo long they were ſecure in their Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and no longer. For, to ſay nothing of their Kings, whoſe Hiſtory is very obſcure, we finde, after they were laid ſide, they erected another Form of ſtanding Power, in a ſingle Perſon, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, a Governour, for Life; who was alſo accountable for miſdemeanours: but yet a Tryal being made of nine of them, the People ſaw ſo little ſecurity by them, that they pitch'd upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtanding Form of Decimal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and being oppreſs'd by them too, they were caſhier'd. The like miſeries they taſted under the ſtanding power of Thirty, which were a ſort of Levellers more rank than all the reſt; who put to death, baniſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d, pill'd, and poll'd whom they pleaſed, without Cauſe or Exception; ſo that the poor people having been tormented under all the Forms of ſtanding Power, were in the end forced (as their laſt remedy) to take Sanctuary under the Form of a
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:115267:49"/>
Free - State, in their ſucceſſive Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.</p>
               <p>And though it may be objected, That afterwards they fell into many diviſions and miſeries, even in that Form: yet whoever obſerves the Story, ſhall finde, it was not the fault of the Government, but of themſelves, in ſwerving from the Rules of a Free-State, by permitting the continuance of Power in particular hands; who having an opportunity thereby to create Parties of their own among the People, did for their own ends, inveigle, ingage, and intangle them in popular Tumults and Diviſions. This was the true Reaſon of their Miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages. And if ever any Government of the People did miſcarry, it was upon that account.</p>
               <p>Thus alſo the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> after they had for ſome yeers tryed the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of one King, then of two Kings at once of two diſtinct Families; afterwards came in the <hi>Ephori,</hi> as Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſers of their Kings: after (I ſay) they had tryed themſelves through all the Forms of a ſtanding Power, and found them all to be Levellers of the Peoples
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:115267:50"/>
Intereſt and Property, then neceſſity taught them to ſeek ſhelter in a Free-State, under which they lived happily, till by a forementioned Error of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians,</hi> they were drawn into Parties by powerful Perſons, and ſo made the Inſtruments of Diviſion among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for the bringing of new Levellers into play; ſuch as were <hi>Manchanidas</hi> and <hi>Nabis,</hi> who ſucceeded each other in a Tyranny.</p>
               <p>In old <hi>Rome,</hi> after the ſtanding Form of Kings was extinct, and a new one eſtabliſhed, the people found as little of ſafety and property as ever: for, the ſtanding Senate, and the <hi>Decemviri,</hi> proved as great Levellers, as Kings: ſo that they were forced to ſettle the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the People by a due and orderly ſucceſſion of their ſupreme Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies. Then they began again to recover their propertie, in having ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what they might call their own; and they happily enjoyed it, till, as by the ſame Error of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians,</hi> ſwerving from the Rules of a Free-State, lengthning of power in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular hands, they were drawn and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:115267:50"/>
into Parties, to ſerve the luſts of ſuch powerful men as by craft became their Leaders: ſo that by this means (through their own default) they were deprived of their Liberty long before the dayes of Imperial Tytanny. Thus <hi>Cinna, Sylla, Marins,</hi> and the reſt of that ſucceeding Gang, down to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> uſed the Peoples favour, to obtain a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of power in their own hands; and then having ſadled the people with a new ſtanding Form of their own, they immediately rooted up the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Liberty and Property, by Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Sentences of death, Proſcriptions, Fines, and Confiſcations: which ſtrain of levelling, (more intolerable than the former) was maintained by the ſame Arts of Devilliſh Policy down to <hi>Caeſar;</hi> who ſtriking in a Favourite of the People, and making uſe of their Affections to lengthen power in his own hands: at length, by this Errour of the people, gained opportunity to introduce a new levelling Form of ſtanding power in himſelf, to an utter and irrecoverable ruine of the Romane Liberty and property.</p>

It was ſo, when the Great Ones ruled: it was ſo under <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derino,</hi> it was ſo under <hi>Savanarola</hi> the Monk. When they once began to lengthen power by the peoples Favour, they preſently fell to levelling and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineering, as did <hi>Coſmus</hi> afterwards, that crafty Founder of the preſent Dukedom.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:115267:51"/>We may from hence ſafely conclude againſt all objecting Monarchs and Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſts, of what name and Title ſoever, that a Free-State or Commonwealth by the people in their ſucceſſive Aſſemblies is ſo far from levelling or deſtroying propertie, that in all ages it hath been the onely preſervative of Liberty and property, and the onely remedy againſt the Levellings and Uſurpations of ſtanding powers: for, it is cleer, That Kings and all ſtanding powers are the Levellers.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Objection in the Mouths of many, is this, That <hi>the erecting of ſuch a Form in the Peoples hands, were the ready way to cauſe confuſion in Government; when all perſons (without diſtinction) are allowed a right to chuſe and be choſen mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſupreme Aſſemblies.</hi>

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:115267:52"/>
a former Government, and thoſe that ſtood for it; in which caſe it even hath a great party within it ſelf, that are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to its eſtabliſhment.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt, to wit, a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth in its ſetled and compoſed ſtate, when all men within it are preſumed to be its Friends, queſtionleſs, a right to chuſe and to be choſen, is then to be allowed the people, (without diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) in as great a latitude, as may ſtand with right Reaſon and Convenience, for managing a matter of ſo high Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence as their Supreme Aſſemblies; wherein ſomewhat muſt be left to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Prudence; and therefore that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude being to be admitted more or leſs, according to the Nature, Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and Neceſſities of any Nation, is not here to be determined.</p>
               <p>But as to a Commonwealth under the ſecond conſideration, when it is founding, or newly founded, in the cloſe of a Civil War, upon the mine of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Government; In this caſe, (I ſay) to make no diſtinction betwixt men; but to allow the conquered part of the people an equal right to chuſe and to

               <p>Now, that the Enemies of Liberty, being ſubdued upon the cloſe of a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil War, are not to be allowed ſharers in the Rights of the people, is evident, for divers Reaſons: not onely becauſe ſuch an allowance would be a means to give them opportunity to ſow the ſeeds of new Broyls and Diviſions, and bring a new hazard upon the Liberties of the People, (which are Reaſons derived from Convenience: but there is a more ſpecial Argument from the equity of the thing, according to the Law and Cuſtom of Nations, That ſuch as have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced War, to ſerve the Luſts of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants againſt the Peoples Intereſt, ſhould not be received any longer a part of the people, but may be handled as ſlaves when ſubdued, if their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duers pleaſe ſo to uſe them; becauſe by their Treaſons againſt the Majeſty of the people, (which they ought to have

maintained) they have made forfeiture of all their Rights and Priviledges, as Members of the People; and therefore if it happens in this caſe at any time, That any Immunities, Properties or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments be indulged unto them, they muſt not take them as their own by Right, but as Boons beſtowed upon them by the peoples courteſie.</p>
               <p>The old Commonwealth of <hi>Greece</hi> was very ſevere in this particular: for, as they were wont to heap up all Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours they could vent, upon ſuch as did or ſuffered any thing for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of their Liberty; ſo, on the other ſide, they puniſhed the Underminers of it, or thoſe that any wayes appeared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, with utmoſt extremity; perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting them with For Feitures, both of Life and Fortune; and if they eſcaped with Life, they uſually became ſlaves: and many times they perſecuted them, being dead, branding their Memories with an Eternal Mark of Infamy.</p>
               <p>In old <hi>Rome</hi> they dealt more mildly with the greateſt part of thoſe that had ſided with the <hi>Tarquins</hi> after their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion: but yet they were not reſtored
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:115267:53"/>
to all their former Priviledges. In pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time, as oft as any conſpired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Peoples Intereſt, in their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Aſſemblies; after they had once gotten them, themſelves were baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and their Eſtates confiſcated, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting many of the Senators, as well as others; and made for ever incapable of any Truſt in the Commonwealth.</p>
               <p>Afterwards, they took the ſame courſe with as many of <hi>Catiline's</hi> Fellow-Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Conſpirators, as were worthy any thing; and had no doubt ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently paid <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Abettors in the ſame Coin, but that he wore out all oppoſites with his proſperous Treaſon. Thus <hi>Millain,</hi> and the reſt of thoſe States, when they were free, as alſo the <hi>Swiſſes</hi> and <hi>Hollanders,</hi> in the Infancy of the <hi>Helvetian</hi> and <hi>Belgick</hi> Freedoms, who took the ſame courſe with all thoſe uu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Paricides and Apoſtates, that offered firſt to ſtrangle their Liberty in the Birth, or afterwards in the Cradle, by ſecret Conſpiracy, or open violence. Nor ought this to ſeem ſtrange, ſince if a right of Conqueſt may be uſed over a Forain, who onely is to be accounted

a fair enemy: much more againſt ſuch, as againſt the light of Nature, ſhall engage themſelves in ſo foul practices, as tend to ruine the Liberty of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Country.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore that the people in their Government, upon all occaſions of Civil War againſt their Liberties, have been moſt zealous in vindicating thoſe Attempts upon the heads of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators: ſeeing alſo, that upon the cloſe of a Civil War, they have a Right; and not onely a Right, but uſually a very great Reſolution to keep out thoſe Enemies of Liberty, whom they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, from a participation of any Right in Government: therefore in this caſe alſo, as well as the former, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That they in their ſucceſſive Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, are ſo far from levelling the Intereſt of Government into all hands, without diſtinction, that their principal care is ever to preſerve it in their own, to prevent the return of new Wars, old Intereſts, and Confuſion.</p>

               </p>
               <p>For anſwer to this, it is requiſite that we take notice of thoſe Occaſions which are the common cauſes of ſuch humours in this Form: which being once known, it will eaſily appear whence thoſe Inconveniences do ariſe, and not from any default in the nature of the Government: they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly theſe three.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to be moſt true, by the courſe of affairs in the Romane State, as they are recorded by <hi>Livy;</hi> who plainly ſhews, that upon the expulſion of the <hi>Tarquins,</hi> though the Senate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced a new Government, yet their retaining the power of the old within the hands of themſelves and their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, was the occaſion of all thoſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Diſcontents
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:115267:57"/>
and Tumults that aroſe among the People. For, had <hi>Brutus</hi> made them free, when he declared them ſo; or had the Senate a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, followed the advice and example of <hi>Publicola,</hi> and ſome others as honeſt as he; all occaſion of Diſcontent had been taken away: but when the People ſaw the Senators ſeated in a lofty po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture over them; when they felt the weight of that State and Dignity preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon ſhoulders that were promiſed to be at eaſe, and free; when they found themſelves exempted from the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſame common Priviledges, excluded from all Offices, or Alliance with the Senators; their purſes empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Money, their bellies of Meat, and their hearts of Hope: then it was, that they began to grumble and mutiny; and never until they got a power to bridle the Great ones, by an happie ſucceſſion of their Supreme Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Occaſion of the peoples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inclined to Diſcontent and Tumult, under their Free Form of Government, appears in Story to be this: When they
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:115267:58"/>
felt themſelves not fairly dealt withal, by ſuch as became their Leaders and Generals. Thus in <hi>Syracuſa, Dionyſius</hi> cloathing himſelf with a pretence of the peoples Liberties; and being by that means made their General, and then making uſe of that power to other ends than was pretended, became the Fire-Brand of that State, and put the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple all into Flames, for the expulſion of him, who had made a Forfeiture of all his glorious pretences.</p>
               <p>Thus in <hi>Sparta</hi> the people were peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able enough under their own Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, till they found themſelves over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reached, and their credulity abuſed by ſuch as they truſted, whoſe deſigns were laid in the dark, for the converting of Liberty into Tyranny, under <hi>Manchani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> and <hi>Nabis.</hi> In old <hi>Rome,</hi> under the peoples Government, it is true, it was a ſad ſight oftentimes to ſee the people ſwarming in tumults, their ſhops ſhut up, and all trading given over throughout the City, and ſomtimes the City forſaken and left empty.</p>
               <p>But here, as alſo in <hi>Ath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ns,</hi> the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was the ſame: for, as the people
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:115267:58"/>
naturally love Peace and Eaſe; ſo find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves often out-witted and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed by the ſlights and fears of the Senate, they preſently (as it is their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon ſuch Occaſions) grew out of all patience. The caſe was the ſame al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, when any one of their Senators, or of themſelves, arrived to any height of power by inſinuating into the peoples favour, upon ſpecious and popular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, and then made a forfeiture of thoſe pretences, by taking a contrary courſe. Thus <hi>Sylla</hi> of the Senatorian order, and <hi>Marius</hi> of the Plebeian, both got power into their hands, upon pretence of the peoples good, (as many others did before and after, not onely in <hi>Rome,</hi> but in other Free-States alſo) but forfeiting their pretences by taking Arbitrary courſes, they were the ſole Cauſes of all thoſe Tumults and Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters among the Romanes, the infamy whereof hath moſt injuriouſly been caſt upon the peoples Government, by the profane pens of ſuch as have been bold in Penſion or Relation in the Courts of Princes.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Caeſar</hi> alſo himſelf, ſtriking as a
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:115267:59"/>
Favorite of the people upon fair pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, and forfeiting them, when in power, was the onely cauſe of all thoſe ſucceeding Civil Broyles and Tragedies among the people.</p>
               <p>A third Occaſion of the Peoples being inclined to Diſcontent and Tumult in a Free-State, is this, when they are ſenſible of Oppreſſion. For, I ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, The people are naturally of a peaceable temper, minding nothing, but a free Enjoyment: but if once they finde themſelves circumvented, miſled, or ſqueezed by ſuch as they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted, then they ſwell like the Sea, and over-run the Bounds of Juſt and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, ruining all before them.</p>
               <p>In a word, there is not one precedent of Tumults or Sedition can be cited out of all Stories, by the Enemies of Freedom, againſt the peoples Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but it will appear likewiſe thereby, that the people were not in fault, but either drawn in, or provoked thereto, by the Craft or Injuſtice of ſuch fair Pretenders as have had by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ends of their own, and by-deſigns upon the publick Liberty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:115267:59"/>Nevertheleſs, admit that the people were tumultuous in their own Nature; yet thoſe Tumults (when they happen) are more eaſily to be borne, than theſe Inconveniences that ariſe from the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of Monarchs and Great Ones: for popular Tumults have theſe three Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities:</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Injury of them never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends further than ſome few Perſons; and thoſe (for the moſt part) guilty e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; as were the thirty Grandees in <hi>Athens,</hi> the Ten in <hi>Rome,</hi> and thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther State-Mountebanks, that ſuffered for their Practices by the Peoples Fury.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Thoſe Tumults are not laſting, but (like fits) quickly over: for, an Eloquent Oration, or Perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (as we ſee in the Example of <hi>Mene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Agrippa</hi>) or the Reputation of ſome grave or honeſt Man, (as in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Virginus,</hi> and afterwards of <hi>Cato</hi>) doth very eaſily reduce and paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The ending of thoſe Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, though they have ruined ſome particulars, yet it appears they have
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:115267:60"/>
uſually turned to the good of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick: for we ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, that both in <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> the Great Ones were by this means kept in awe from Injuſtice; the Spirits of the people were kept warm with high thoughts of themſelves and their Liberty (which turned much to the inlargement of their Empire.)</p>
               <p>And laſtly, By this means they came off alwayes with good Laws for their profit, (as in the caſe of the Law of twelve Tables, brought from <hi>Athens</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi>) or elſe with an Augmentation of their Immunities, and Priviledges (as in the caſe of procuring the Tribunes, and their Supreme Aſſemblies) and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in the frequent confirmation of them againſt the Incroachments of the Nobles.</p>
               <p>Now the caſe is far otherwiſe under the ſtanding power of the Great Ones; they, in their Counſels, Projects, and Deſigns, are faſt and tenacious; ſo that the Evils under thoſe Forms are more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medileſs. Beſides, they reach to the whole Body of a Commonweal: and ſo the Evils are more Univerſal. And laſtly, thoſe Tumults, Quarrels, and Inconveniences
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:115267:60"/>
that ariſe from among them, never tend nor end, but to the farther oppreſſion and ſuppreſſion of the people in their Intereſt and Propriety.</p>
               <p>For concluſion then: by theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars you may plainly ſee the vanity of this Objection about Tumults, how far they are from being natural effects of the Peoples Government; inſomuch, as by the Records of Hiſtory, it appears rather that they have been the neceſſary conſequences of ſuch Tricks and Cheats of Great Men, as in the dayes of yore have been put upon the people.</p>

               </p>
               <p>For anſwer to this, know, That ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniation (which ſignifies ambitious
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:115267:61"/>
ſlandering of men, by whiſperings, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, or falſe accuſations) was never allowed or approved in this Form of Government. 'Tis true indeed, that ſuch Extravagancies there have been (more or leſs) in all Forms whatſoever; but in this, leſs than any: it being moſt in uſe under ſtanding Powers of Great ones, who make it their grand Engine to remove or ruine all perſons that ſtand in the way of them and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes: And for this purpoſe, it hath ever been their common cuſtom to have Inſtruments ready at hand; as we ſee in all the Stories of Kings and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees from time to time; yea, and by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf, together with the whole train of Commentators, it is particularly mark'd out <hi>inter flagitia Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minationis,</hi> to be one of the peculiar enormities that attend the Lordly inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of Dominion.</p>
               <p>The Romane State, after it grew cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, is a ſufficient Inſtance; where we finde, that not onely the ten Grandees, but all that ſucceeded them in that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineering humour over the People, ever kept a Retinue well ſtock'd with
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:115267:61"/>
Calumniators and Informers, (ſuch as we call <hi>Knights of the Poſt</hi>) to ſnap thoſe that in any wiſe appeared for the Peoples Liberties. This was their conſtant trade, as it was afterwards al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of their Emperours. But all the while that the People kept their power entire in the Supreme Aſſemblies, we read not of its being brought into any conſtant practice. Sometimes indeed, thoſe great Commanders that had done them many eminent Services, were, by reaſon of ſome after-actions, called to an account; and having, by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And in the Stories of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Commonwealth, we finde, that by their lofty and unwary carriage, they ſtirr'd up the Peoples fear and jealouſie ſo far, as to queſtion and ſend divers of them into B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>iſhment, notwithſtanding all their former merits; as we read of <hi>Alcibtades, Themiſtocles,</hi> and others: whereas, if the Rules of a Free-State had been punctually obſerved, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:115267:62"/>
a diſcreet revolution of Powers, and an equability, or moderate ſtate of particular perſons, there had been no occaſion of Incroachment on the one part, or of Fear on the other; not could the prying Royaliſt have had the leaſt pretence or ſhadow of Invective againſt the Peoples Government in this particular.</p>
               <p>Thus much of Calumniation, which is leſs frequent under the Peoples Form, than any other.</p>
               <p>Now as to the point of Accuſing, or liberty of Accuſation by the People, before their Supreme Aſſemblies; it is a thing ſo eſſentially neceſſary for the preſervation of a Commonwealth, that there is no poſſibility of having perſons kept accountable without it; and, by conſequence, no ſecurity of Life and Eſtate, Liberty and Property. And of what excellent uſe this is, for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like benefit of any State, appears in theſe two particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is apparent, that the reaſon wherefore Kings, and all other ſtanding Powers, have preſumed to abuſe the People, is, becauſe their continuation

of Authority having been a means to ſtate them in a condition of Impunity, the People either durſt not, or could not aſſume a liberty of Accuſation; and ſo have linger'd without remedy, whilſt Great Men have proceeded with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out control to an Augmentation of their miſery: whereas if a juſt Liberty of Accuſation be kept in ure, and Great Perſons by this means lie liable to queſtioning, the Commonwealth muſt needs be the more ſecure; becauſe none then will dare to intrench, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt ought, againſt their Liberty; and in caſe any do, they may with much eaſe be ſuppreſs'd. All which amounts, in effect, to a full confirmation of this moſt excellent Maxime, recorded in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie: <hi>Maximè intereſt Repub. Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis, ut liberè poſſis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, it appears, this Liberty is moſt neceſſary, becauſe, as it hath been the onely Remedy againſt the Injuſtice of great and powerful perſons; ſo it
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:115267:63"/>
hath been the onely means to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh thoſe Emulations, Jealouſies, and Suſpicions, which uſually abound with fury in mens mindes, when they ſee ſuch perſons ſeated ſo far above, that they are not able to reach them, or bring them (as it becomes all earthly Powers) to an account of their actions: of which Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty when the People have ſeen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves deprived in time paſt, it is ſad to conſider how they have flown out into ſuch abſurd and extraordinary courſes, in hope of Remedy, as have cauſed not onely Diſtraction, but many times utter Ruine, to the Publike. Moſt of thoſe Tumults in old <hi>Rome,</hi> were occaſioned for want of this liberty in ordinary; as thoſe that happened under the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemviri:</hi> ſo that the People, not having freedom to accuſe and queſtion their Juſtice, were enflamed to commit ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Outrages, to be revenged upon them. But when they had once ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained power to accuſe or queſtion any man, by aſſiſtance of their Tribunes; then we meet with none of thoſe heats and fits among them; but they referr'd themſelves over, with much content, to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:115267:63"/>
the ordinary courſe of proceeding. A pregnant Inſtance whereof, we have in the Caſe of <hi>Coriolanus;</hi> who having done ſome injury to the people, they finding him befriended and upheld by the Great ones, reſolved to be reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon him with their own hands; and had torn him in pieces as he came out of the Senate, but that the Tribunes immediately ſtep'd in, and not onely promis'd, but appointed them a day of Hearing againſt him; and ſo all was calm again, and quiet: whereas, if this ordinary courſe of Remedy, in calling him to account, had not been allow'd, and he been deſtroy'd in a Mutiny, a world of ſad Conſequences muſt have befallen the Commonwealth, by reaſon of thoſe Enormities and Revenges that would have riſen, upon the ruine of ſo conſiderable a perſon.</p>
               <p>In the Stories of <hi>Florence</hi> alſo, we read of one <hi>Valeſius,</hi> who greatning himſelf into little leſs than the poſture of a Prince in that Republike, he ſo confirm'd himſelf, that the people not being able to regulate his extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies by any ordinary proceedings, they
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:115267:64"/>
betook themſelves to that unhappie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of Arms; and it coſt the beſt blood and lives in that State, before they could bring him down: involving them in a world of Miſeries, which might have been avoided, had they taken care to preſerve their old Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Accuſation and Que<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ion, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to take a courſe with him in an ordinary way of progreſs.</p>
               <p>Thus alſo in the ſame State, <hi>Sode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rino,</hi> a man of the ſame ſize, intereſt, and humour; when the People ſaw that they had loſt their Liberty, in being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to queſtion him, ran like mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men upon a Remedy as bad as the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and called in the Spaniard to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs him: ſo that turned almoſt to the ruine of the State, which might have been prevented, could they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd him by the ordinary way of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation and Queſtion.</p>
               <p>From theſe Premiſes, then, let us conclude, That ſeeing the crooked way of Calumniation is leſs uſed under the Peoples Form of Government, than any other: and ſince the retaining of a Regular courſe, for admitting and deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:115267:64"/>
of all Complaints and Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies by way of Accuſation, is of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity to the ſafety and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being of a Commonwealth; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Objection is of as little weight as the reſt, ſo as in any wiſe to diminiſh the Dignity and Reputation of a Free-State, or Government by the People in their ſucceſſive Aſſemblies.</p>

               </p>
               <p>For anſwer, firſt, as to the point of being Factious, we have already ſhewn, that this Government, ſtated in a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of its Supreme Aſſemblies, is the onely preventive of Faction; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, in creating a Faction, there is a neceſſity, that thoſe which endeavour it, muſt have oportunity to improve their ſlights and projects, in diſgniſing their Deſignes; drawing in Inſtruments and Parties, and in worming out Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites: the effecting of all which, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ſome length of time; which
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:115267:65"/>
cannot be had, and conſequently, no Faction form'd, when Government is not fixed in particular perſons, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by due ſucceſſion and revolution of Authority in the hands of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>Beſides, it is to be conſidered, that the People are never the firſt or princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal in Faction: they are never the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors and contrivers of it, but ever the parties that are drawn into Sidings by the influence of ſtanding Powers, to ſerve their intereſts and deſignes.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Marius, Pompey</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> continuing power in their own hands, cleft the Romane Empire at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times into ſeveral Parties: as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards it was cleft into three by the Triumvirate; wherein the people had no hand, being (as they are alwayes) purely paſſive, and paſſionately divided, according as they were wrought upon by the ſub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thus <hi>Italy</hi> was divided into <hi>Guelph</hi> and <hi>Gib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:115267:65"/>
Confederates; wherein the people had no further hand, than as they were acted by the perſwaſions and pretences of two powerful parties.</p>
               <p>The caſe alſo was the ſame in <hi>England,</hi> in times paſt, when the Grandee-Game was in action between the two Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of <hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter.</hi> So that it is clear enough, The people in their own nature are not inclined to be Factious, nor are they ever ingaged that way, far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than as their Nature is abuſed, and drawn in by powerful perſons.</p>
               <p>The ſecond particular of this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, is Inconſtancy; which holds true indeed in them that are debauched, and in the corrupted State of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, when degenerated from its pure Principles; as we finde in that of <hi>Athens, Rome, Florence,</hi> and others: but yet in <hi>Rome</hi> you may ſee as preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant inſtances of that peoples conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as of any other ſort of men whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: for, they continued conſtant irreconcilable Enemies to all Tyranny in general, and Kingly power in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
               <p>In like manner, when they had once
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:115267:66"/>
gotten their ſucceſſive Aſſemblies, they remained ſo firm &amp; ſtiff to uphold them, that the ſucceeding Tyrants could not in a long time, nor without extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary cunning and caution deprive them of that onely Evidence of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
               <p>Moreover, it is obſervable of this people, That in making their Elections they could never be perſwaded to chuſe a known Infamous, Vitious, or unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Fellow; ſo that they ſeldom or never erred in the choice of their Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes and other Officers. And as in the framing of Laws, their aim was ever at the general Good, it being their own Intereſt, <hi>quatenus</hi> the people; ſo their conſtancy in the conſervation of thoſe Laws was moſt remarkable: for, notwithſtanding all the crafty Devices and Fetches of the Nobles, the people could never be woo'd to a conſent of abrogating any one Law, till by the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of Time, Affairs, and other Circumſtances, it did plainly appear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient.</p>
               <p>But the caſe hath ever been otherwiſe under Kings and all ſtanding Powers,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:115267:66"/>
who uſually ran into all the extreams of Inconſtancy, upon every new Project, petty Humour, and Occaſion, that ſeemed favourable for effecting of their by-deſigns. And in order hereunto, Stories will inform you, That it hath been their Cuſtome, to ſhift Principles every Moon, and caſhier all Oaths, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations, Promiſes, and Engagements, and blot out the Memory of them with a wet Finger.</p>
               <p>This was very remarkable in the late King, whoſe inconſtancy in this kinde, was beyond compare; who no ſooner had paſſed any Promiſes, made Vows and Proteſtations, fix'd Appeals in the High Court of Heaven, in the behalf of Himſelf and his Family; but preſently he forfeited all, and cancell'd them by his Actions.</p>
               <p>As to the third point, of Ingratitude, it is much charged upon this Form of Government; becauſe we read both in <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> of divers unhandſome Returns made to ſome worthy Perſons that had done high ſervices for thoſe Commonwealths; as <hi>Alcibiades, The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Camillus, Coriolanus,</hi> and both the <hi>Scipio's;</hi> the cauſe of whoſe misfortunes is deſcribed by <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Livy,</hi> to be their own lofty and unwary carriage; Having (ſay they) by an ingroſsment of power, rendred themſelves ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and buthenſome to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and thereby ſtirred up the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples fear &amp; jealouſie: where as if they had kept themſelves within the Rules of a Free-State, by permitting a diſceet Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution of power in particular hands; there had been no occaſion of incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the one part, nor of fear on the other. Of all, the <hi>Scipio's</hi> indeed were moſt to be pitied, becauſe their only fault ſeems to be too much power and grearneſs, (which indeed is the greateſt fault that Members of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth can be guilty of, if ſeriouſly conſidered;) inſomuch, that being grown formidable to their Fellow-Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators, they were by them removed: and ſo it appears to have been the act of the Nobles, (upon their own ſcore and Intereſt) and not of the people. But as for <hi>Camillus</hi> and <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> they ſufficiently deſerved whatſoever befel
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:115267:67"/>
them, becauſe they made uſe of the power and reputation they had gotten by their former merits, onely to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligne and exerciſe an implacable hate towards the peoples Intereſt. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, the people reſtored <hi>Camillus</hi> again to his Eſtate and Honour, after ſome little time of Baniſhment.</p>
               <p>And though this accident in a Free-State hath been objected by many, as a great deffect; yet others again do highly commend the humour: For (ſay they) it is not onely a good ſign of a Commonwealths being in pure and perfect health, when the people are thus active, zealous, and jealous in the behalf of their Liberties, that will permit no ſuch growth of power as may endanger it; but it is alſo a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient means to curb the Ambition of its Citizens, and make them contain within due bounds, when they ſee there is no preſuming after Inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Acceſſions of Powers and Greatneſs, without incurring the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and indignation of the people.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the Reaſon why the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:115267:68"/>
people many times caſt off perſons that have done them eminent ſervices: yet on the other ſide, they were ſo far from Ingratitude, that they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes been exceſſive in their Rewards and Honours, to ſuch men as deſerved any way of the Publike, whilſt they conformed themſelves to Rules, and kept in a poſture ſuiting to Liberty. Witneſs their Conſecration of Statues, Incenſe, Sacrifices, and Crowns of Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, inrolling ſuch men in the number of their Deities.</p>
               <p>Therefore the crime of Ingratitude cannot in any peculiar manner be faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon the People: but if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the Stories of all ſtanding Powers, we may produce innumerable teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of their Ingratitude toward ſuch as have done them the greateſt ſervice; ill recompence being a Myſtery of State practiſed by all Kings and Grandees, who (as <hi>Tacitus</hi> tells us) ever count themſelves diſobliged, by the braveſt actions of their ſubjects.</p>
               <p>Upon this account, <hi>Alexander</hi> hated <hi>Antipater</hi> and <hi>Parmenio,</hi> and put the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to death. Thus the Emperour <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaſian</hi>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:115267:68"/>
caſhiered and ruined the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious <hi>Antonies.</hi> Thus alſo was <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſus Atbuquerque</hi> ſerved by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the King of <hi>Portugal;</hi> and <hi>Conſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus</hi> the Great, by <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Aragon:</hi> as was alſo that <hi>Stanley</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>Derby,</hi> who ſet the Crown upon King <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Innumerable are the Examples of this kinde, which evidence, that ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy dealings are the effect of all ſtanding Powers; and therefore more properly to be objected againſt them, than againſt the Government of the People.</p>
               <p>Thus having anſwered all, or the main Objections, brought by the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of a Free-State; before we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Errours of Government, and Rules of Policie, it will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs, but very convenient, to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

               <p>Thus the Paternal Form became changed into a Tyrannical. Neither of theſe had (I confeſs) their Original
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:115267:70"/>
in or from the People, nor hath either of them any relation to that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which we intend in our Poſition.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, There is a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Political, not grounded in Nature, nor upon Paternal Right by Natural Generation; but founded upon the free Election, Conſent or mutual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact of men entring into a form of civil ſociety. This is the Government we now ſpeak of, it having been in requeſt in moſt ages, and ſtill is: whereas the other was long ſince out of date, being uſed onely in the firſt age of the World, as proper onely for that time.</p>
               <p>So that to prevent all Objections of this nature, when we ſpeak here of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, we mean onely the Political, which is by Conſent or Compact; whoſe original we ſhall prove to be in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. As for the Government of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> firſt under <hi>Moſes,</hi> then <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the Judges; The Scripture plainly ſhews, that they were extraordi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nary Governours, being of God's immediate inſtitution, who raiſed them up by his Spirit, and impoſed them upon that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; whoſe peculiar happineſs it was in
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:115267:71"/>
caſes of this nature, to have ſo infallible and ſure a direction; ſo that their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was a Theocracie, (as ſome have called it) having God himſelf for its onely Original: and therefore no wonder we have in that time &amp; Nation, ſo few viſible foot-ſteps of the peoples Election, or of an inſtitution by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact. But yet we finde after the Judges, when this people rejected this more immediate way of Government by God, (as the Lord told <hi>Samuel, They have not rejected thee, but me</hi>) and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſired a Government after the manner of other Nations; then God ſeems to forbear the uſe of his Prerogative, and leave them to an exerciſe of their own natural Rights and Liberties, to make choice of a new Government and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour by ſuffrage and compact.</p>
               <p>The Government they aimed at, was Kingly: God himſelf was diſpleaſed at it, and ſo was <hi>Samuel</hi> too; who, in hope to continue the old Form, and to fright them from the new, tells them, what Monſters in Government Kings would prove, by aſſuming unto themſelves an Arbitrary Power, (not that a King might

lawfully and by right do what <hi>Samuel</hi> deſcribes, but onely to ſhew how far Kings would preſume to abuſe their power; which no doubt <hi>Samuel</hi> foreſaw, not onely by Reaſon, but by the Spirit of Prophecie.) Nevertheleſs the people would have a King; ſay they, <hi>Nay, but there ſhall be a King over us:</hi> whereupon, ſaith God to <hi>Samuel, Hearken to their voice.</hi> Where we plainly ſee; firſt, God gives them leave to uſe their own natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rights, in making choice of their own Form of Government; but then indeed, for the choice of their Governor, there was one thing extraordinary, in that God appointed them one, he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafing ſtill in an extraordinary and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate manner to be their Director and Protector: but yet, though God was pleaſed to nominate the perſon, he left the confirmation and ratification of the Kingſhip unto the people; to ſhew, that naturally the right of all was in them, however the exerciſe of it were ſuperſeded at that time, by his Divine pleaſure, as to the point of nomination: for, that the people might underſtand it was their Right, <hi>Samuel</hi> calls them
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:115267:72"/>
all to <hi>Mizpeh,</hi> as if the matter were all to be done anew on their part; and there by lot, they at length made choice of <hi>Saul,</hi> and ſo immediately by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming him with ſhouts and acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and then having had proof of his valour againſt the <hi>Amorites,</hi> they meet at <hi>Gilgal,</hi> and proclaim him King once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, to ſhew that (naturally) the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the Kingſhip depended wholly upon the peoples conſent and confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And ſo you ſee the firſt and moſt eminent evidence of the inſtitution of Political Government in Scripture doth notoriouſly demonſtrate, that its origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal is in or from the people; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall wave any further inſtances in caſes of the like nature out of Scripture, which are not a few. Onely let it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, that <hi>Peter</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle, calls all Government the Ordinance of man, (in the Original, <hi>the creation of man,</hi> a Creature of a mans making) to ſhew, that in all its forms it depends onely upon the will &amp; pleaſure of the people.</p>
               <p>We might inſiſt farther to evince the Truth of this by ſtrength of Reaſon; but let this ſerve to aſſert the right of the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:115267:72"/>
thing; and as for the reſt, every man will eaſily believe it very conſonant to reaſon, if he reflect upon the matter of fact, and conſider, that it hath been the unanimous practice of all the Nations of the World, to aſſert their own Rights of Election and Conſent (as often as they had opportunity) in the various turns of inſtitution and alteration of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In <hi>Italy</hi> of old they had moſt Free-States, and few Princes; now all Princes, and no Free-States. <hi>Naples,</hi> after many Revolutions, is under <hi>Spain, Rome</hi> under a Pope, and under him one Senator, in ſtead of thoſe many that were wont to be; <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Genoa</hi> have Senators and Dukes, but the Dukes are of ſmall power; <hi>Florence, Ferrara, Mantua, Parma,</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi> have no Senators, but Dukes only, and they abſolute; <hi>Burgundy, Lorain, Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coin,</hi> and <hi>Britany,</hi> had once Kings, then Dukes, but now are incorporated into <hi>France:</hi> ſo all the Principalities of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> that now are, were once imbodied in one entire Regiment: <hi>Caſtile, Aragon, Portugal, &amp; Barcelona,</hi> were once diſtinct Kingdoms, but now united all to <hi>Spain,</hi> ſave <hi>Portugal,</hi> which fell off the other
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:115267:73"/>
day: <hi>France</hi> was firſt one Kingdom un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Pharamond,</hi> afterwards parted into four Kingdoms, and at laſt become one again: <hi>England</hi> conſiſted of Free-States till the <hi>Romans</hi> yoked it, afterwards it was divided into ſeven Kingdoms, and in the end it became one again. Thus you ſee how the world is ſubject to ſhiftings of Government: and though it be moſt true, that the power of the Sword hath been moſt prevalent in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe changes, yet ſome of them have been chiefly managed (as they ought) by the peoples Conſent; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in thoſe where the Sword hath made way, the peoples conſent hath ever been drawn and taken in afterwards, for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboration of Title; it having been the cuſtom of all Uſurpers, to make their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtitures appear as juſt as they could, by getting the Communities Conſent <hi>ex poſt ſacto,</hi> and entring into ſome compact with them, for the better eſtabliſhing themſelves with a ſhew of legality: which act of all Tyrants and Uſurpers, is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt (though tacite) confeſſion of theirs, <hi>That</hi> de jure <hi>the original of all Power and Government, is and ought to be in the people.</hi>

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:115267:74"/>
that particular Nation, excluding all others. But if any man will argue from hence, that it is lawfull for any Nation now under the Goſpel to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this pattern; then it behoves him, 1. to prove, that God intended the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Government as a pattern for us to follow under the Goſpel. And if any man will pretend to this, then in the ſecond place, it will concern him to prove, that we are to follow it in every particular, or onely in ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. That we are to follow it in every one, no ſober man did ever yet affirm: And if they will have us to follow it in ſome particulars, relinquiſhing the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſt, then it concerns him to produce ſome Rule or Command out of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, plainly pointing out what parts of it we are to imbrace, and what not; or elſe he will never be able to make it appear, that the Form of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was ever intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, either in the whole, or in part, as a Pattern for Chriſtians to follow under the Goſpel. But never was any ſuch Rule alleadged yet out of Scripture by thoſe that pretend to a Nationall Church.</p>
               <p>And therefore, if we ſeriouſly reflect
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:115267:75"/>
upon the Deſign of God, in ſending Chriſt into the World, we ſhall find it was to ſet an end to that Pompous Adminiſtration of the Jewiſh Form; that as his Church and People were formerly confined within the Narrow Pale of a particular Nation, ſo now the Pale ſhould be broken down, and all Nations taken into the Church: Not all Nations in a lump; nor any whole Nations, or National Bodies to be formed into Churches; for his Church or People, now under the Goſpel, are not to be a Body Political, but Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and Myſtical: Not a promiſcuous confuſion of perſons, taken in at ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture; but an orderly collection, a picking and chuſing of ſuch as are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and ſanctified; and not a company of men forced in, by Commands and Conſtitutions, of Worldly Powers and Prudence; but of ſuch as are brought in by the Power and Efficacy of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Word and Spirit: for he himſelf hath ſaid, <hi>My Kingdome is not of this World; it is not from hence,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore, that hand which hitherto hath preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, in moſt Nations, to erect a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, called Eccleſiaſtick, in equipage with the Civil, to bear <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

mens Conſciences to retain Notions, ordained for Orthodox, upon civill penalties, under colour of prudence, good order, diſcipline, preventing of Hereſie, advancing of Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; and to this end; hath twiſted the Spiritual Power (as they call it) with the Worldly and ſecular intereſt of State: This (I ſay) hath been the very right hand of Antichriſt, oppoſing Chriſt in his way: Whoſe Kingdom, Government, Governours, Officers, and Rulers; Laws, Ordinances, and Statutes, being not of this World, (I mean, <hi>jure humano,</hi>) depend not upon the helps and devices of Worldly wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <p>Upon this ſcore and pretence, the Infant Myſtery of Iniquity began to work in the very Cradle of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>Afterwards it grew up by the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Emperours, whom though God uſed in many good things for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of groſs Heathen Idolatry, yet (by Gods permiſſion) they were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed away, and their eyes ſo far dazled, through the glorious pretences of the Prelates and Biſhops, that they could
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:115267:76"/>
not ſee the old Serpent in a new Form wrapt up in a Myſtery; for, Satan had a new Game now to play, which he managed thus: Firſt, he led a great part of the World away with danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Errours, thereby to find an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the Prelates, to carry on the myſtery of their Profeſſion; and ſo, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of ſuppreſſing thoſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous errors they eaſily ſcrued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the Civil Power: and for continuing of it the ſurer in their own hands, they made bold to baptize whole Nations with the name of Chriſtian, that they might (under the ſame pretence) gain a ſhare of Power and Authority with the Magiſtrate in every Nation; which they ſoon effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
               <p>The Infant-being thus nurſt, grew up in a ſhort time to a perfect man, the man of ſin (if the Pope be the man, which is yet controverted by ſome:) for, the Prelates having gotten the power in their hands, began then to quarrel, who ſhould be the greateſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. At length, he of <hi>Rome</hi> bore away the Bell; and ſo the next ſtep was, that, from National Churches they proceed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Now they were up ſee what a do there was to get any part of them down again. What a Quarter and Commotion there was in <hi>Germany,</hi> when <hi>Luther</hi> firſt brake the Ice? And the like here in <hi>England,</hi> when our firſt Reformers began their Work: Theſe men, in part, did well, but having baniſhed the Popes actual Tyranny, they left the Seed, and Principle of it, ſtill behind, which was, a State Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical united with the Civil; for, the Biſhops twiſted their own intereſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with that of the Crown, upon a Proteſtant Accompt; and by vertue of that, perſecuted thoſe they called Puritans, for not being as Orthodox (they ſaid) as themſelves.</p>

               <p>The Intereſt of abſolute Monarchy,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:115267:77"/>
we conceive to be an unlimited, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controlable, unaccountable ſtation of Power and Authority in the hands of a particular perſon, who governs onely according to the Dictates of his own Will and Pleaſure. And though it hath often bin diſguiſed by Sophiſters in Policy, ſo as it hath loſt its own name, by ſhifting Formes; yet really, and effectually, the thing in it ſelf hath bin diſcovered under the artificial co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of every Form, in the various Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions of Government: So that nothing more concerns a People eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in a ſtate of Freedom, than to be inſtructed in things of this Nature, that the means of its preſervation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing underſtood, and the ſubtil ſleight of old Projectors brought into open view, they may become the more zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to promote the one, and prevent the other, if any old game ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be plaid over anew, by any ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Generation.</p>
               <p>It is very obſervable in <hi>Athens,</hi> that when they had laid aſide their King, the Kingly power was retained ſtill in all the after-turns of Government: for their Decimal Governours, and their Thirty (commonly called the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:115267:78"/>
Tyrants) were but a multiplied Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, the Monarchal Intereſt being held up as high as ever, in keeping the exerciſe of the Supremacy out of the peoples hands, and ſeating themſelves in an unaccountable ſtate of Power and Authority, which was ſomewhat a worſe condition, than the people were in before; for their Kings had Superviſors, and there were alſo Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Aſſemblies, that did reſtrain and correct them: but the new Governors having none, ran into all the heats and fits, and wild extravagancies, of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded Prerogative: by which means, Neceſſity and Extremity open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the peoples Eyes, they, at length, ſaw all the Inconveniencies of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip wrapt up in new Forms, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther increaſed, than diminiſhed; ſo that (as the onely Remedy) they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodged the Power out of thoſe hands, putting it into their own, and placing it in a conſtant orderly Revolution of perſons Elective by the Community. And now being at this fair paſs, one would have thought there was no ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for a Monarchal Intereſt, under a popular Form too. But alaſs, they found the contrary; for, the people not
<pb facs="tcp:115267:78"/>
keeping a ſtrict Watch over them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, according to the Rules of a Free State; but being won by ſpecious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, and deluded by created Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, to intruſt the management of Affairs into ſome particular hands, ſuch an occaſion was given thereby to thoſe men to frame parties of their own, that by this means, they in a ſhort time became able to ſtand upon their own legs, and do what they liſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the peoples conſent: and in the end, not onely diſcontinued, but utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extirpated their ſucceſſive Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Rome</hi> alſo, the Caſe was the ſame under every Alteration; and all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, by the crafty contrivances of Grandiſing Parties, and the peoples own facility and negligence, in ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves to be deluded: for, with the <hi>Tarquin's,</hi> (as it is obſerved by <hi>Livy,</hi> and others) onely the name King was expelled, but not the thing; the Power &amp; Intereſt of Kingſhip was ſtill retained in the Senate, and ingroſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Conſuls: For, beſides the Rape of <hi>Lucrece,</hi> among the other faults objected againſt <hi>Tarquin,</hi> this was moſt conſiderable, That he had

acted all things after his own head; and diſcontinued Conſultations with the Senate, which was the very height of Arbitrary Power. But yet as ſoon as the Senate was in the ſaddle, they forgat what was charged by themſelves upon <hi>Tarquin,</hi> and ran into the ſame Errour, by eſtabliſhing an Arbitrary, Hereditary, unaccountable Power in themſelves, and their Poſterity, not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the people (whoſe intereſt and liberty they had pleaded, into any ſhare in Conſultation, or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as they ought to have done, by a preſent erecting of their ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Aſſemblies: ſo that you ſeethe ſame Kingly Intereſt, which was in one before, reſided then in the hands of many.

But yet for all this, the people were cheated through their own neglect, and beſtowing too much confidence and truſt upon ſuch as they thought their friends: For when they ſwerved from the Rules of a <hi>Free-State,</hi> by lengthning the Dictatorſhip in any hand, then <hi>Monarchick-Intereſt</hi> ſtept in there, as it did under <hi>Sylla, Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> and others, long before it returned to a declared Monarchal Form; and when they lengthned Commands in their Armies, then it crept in there; as it did under the afore-named perſons, as well as <hi>Marius, Cinna,</hi> and others alſo; and even <hi>Pompey</hi> himſelf, not forgetting alſo the pranks of the two <hi>Triumvirales,</hi> who all made a ſhift: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der every Form, being ſometimes cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Conſuls, ſometimes Dictators, and ſometimes Tribunes of the people, to out-act all the Flagitions Enormities of an abſolute Monarchy.</p>
               <p>It is alſo evident in the Story of <hi>Florence,</hi> that that Common-wealth, even when it ſeemed moſt free, could never quite ſhake off the Intereſt of Monarchy: for, it was ever the buſineſs of one Upſtart, or other; either in the Senate, or among the People, to make

way to their own ambitious Ends, and hoiſt themſelves into a Kingly po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture through the Peoples favour, as we may ſee in the Actions of <hi>Savana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rola</hi> the Monk, <hi>Soderino,</hi> and the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> whoſe Family did (as we ſee at this day) fix it ſelf at length in the State of an abſolute Monarchy, under the Title of a Dukedome.

               <p>Now the uſe that is to be made of this Diſcourſe, is this, that ſince it is clear, the Intereſt of Monarchy may reſide in a Conſul; as well as in a King; in a Dictator, as well as in a Conſul; in the hands of many, as well as of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle perſon; and that its Cuſtom hath bin to lurk under every Form, in the various turnes of Government, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as it concerns every people in a State of Freedome to keep cloſe to the Rules of a <hi>Free-State,</hi> for the turning out of Monarchy (whether ſimple, or compound, both name and thing, in one or many) by which means onely they will be inabled to avoid this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Error in Policy; ſo they ought ever to have a Reverent and Noble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:115267:87"/>
long in their own hands: for when <hi>Caeſar</hi> marched to <hi>Rome,</hi> he deprived them alſo of the Authority of their Suffrages; onely in a formal way made uſe of them, and ſo under a ſhadow of legality, he aſſumed that power unto himſelf, which they durſt not deny him.</p>
               <p>Juſt in the ſame manner dealt <hi>Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> with the <hi>Flerentine Senate:</hi> he made uſe of their Suffrages, but he had ſo plaid his Cards before-hand, that they durſt not but yield to his Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So alſo <hi>Tiberius,</hi> when he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to ſettle himſelf, firſt brought the Suffrages of the Senate at his own Devotion, that they durſt not but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to his Eſtabliſhment; and then ſo ordered the matter, that he might ſeem to do nothing, not only without their conſent; but to be forced to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Empire by their intreaty: ſo that you ſee, there was an Empire, in Effect, long before it was declared in Formality.</p>
               <p>From hence, therefore, we may clearly deduce the neceſſity of this Rule in a <hi>Free-State,</hi> from the practice of times paſt, that no State can preferits Freedom, but by maintaining the free

               <p>That nothing could at any time be impoſed upon the people, but by their conſent; that is, by the conſent of themſelves; or of ſuch as were by them intruſted: this was a Rule moſt ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practiſed in all the <hi>Free-States</hi> of <hi>Greece:</hi> For, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> tells us, in his fourth Book of <hi>Politicks,</hi> they ever had ſpecial care to place the Uſe and Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Arms in the people: becauſe (ſay they) the Common-wealth is theirs who held the Arms.</p>
               <p>The Sword, and Soveraignty, ever walk hand in hand together. The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans were very curious in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, after they had gained a plenary

poſſeſſion of Liberty in their Tribunes, and ſucceſſive Aſſemblies, <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, and the Territories about it, was trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned up perpetually in Arms, and the whole Common-weal, by this means became one formal <hi>Militia,</hi> a generall Exerciſe of the beſt part of the people in the uſe of Arms, was the onely Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark of their Liberty: This was reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned the ſureſt way to preſerve it both at home, and abroad: the Majeſty of the People being ſecured thereby, as well againſt Domeſtick Affronts from any of their own Citizens, as againſt the forraign Invaſions of bad Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors.</p>
               <p>Their Arms were never lodged in the hands of any, but ſuch as had an Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in the Publick; ſuch as were acted by that Intereſt not drawn only by Pay; ſuch as thought themſelves well paid, in repelling Invaders that they might with <hi>Freedome</hi> return to their Affairs: For, the truth is, ſo long as <hi>Rome</hi> acted by the pure Principles of a <hi>Free-State,</hi> it uſed no Arms to defend itſelf, but, ſuch as we call, ſufficient men; ſuch, as for the moſt part were men of Eſtate, Maſters of Families, that took Arms (only upon occaſion) <hi>pro

In thoſe days there was no difference, in order, between the Citizen, the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, and the Souldier: for, he that was a Citizen, or Villager yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, became a Souldier the next, if the <hi>Publick Liberty</hi> required it; and that being ſecured, by repelling of Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, both <hi>Forreign</hi> and <hi>Domeſtick,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly the Souldier became Citizen again: ſo that the firſt and beſt brave Roman Generals, and Souldiers, came from the Plough, and returned thither when the Work was over.</p>
               <p>This was the uſual courſe even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had gained their Tribunes and Aſſemblies; that is, in the Infancy of the Senate, immediatly after the Expulſion of their Kings: for, then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the <hi>Senatick Aſſembly,</hi> there were ſome Sparks of Liberty in being, and they took this courſe to maintain it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Tarquins</hi> being driven out, but having a Party left ſtill within, that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to make ſeveral Invaſions, with confidence to carry all before them: and yet in the Intervalls, we find not any form of ſouldiery; only

               <p>And in the paſſage of that River, this following Inſcription was erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to put the men of Arms in mind of their duty: <hi>Imperator, ſive miles, ſive Tyrannus armatus quiſquis, ſiſtito vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illum arma<expan>

               <p>For this cauſe it was, that when <hi>Caeſar</hi> had preſumed once to march over this River, he conceived himſelf ſo far ingaged, that there was no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat; no Game next, but have at all, advanceth to <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, into a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Empire.</p>

               <p>And for confirmation of this, we might cite the various Teſtimonies of <hi>Plutarch, Iſocrates,</hi> with many more, both Philoſophers, Orators, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that have treated of this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, touching the Education of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as it relates either to Domeſtick, or Civil Government: But we ſhall take it for granted, without more ado, ſuppoſing none will deny, of what effect it is, in all the Concernments of Mankind, either in Converſation, or in Action.</p>
               <p>The neceſſity of this Point, appears

               <p>Upon this account it was, that in <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Iſocrates,</hi> we find ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good Teſtimonies of the great care that was had amongſt all the <hi>Free-States</hi> of <hi>Greece</hi> in this particular, which tyed up their Paedagogues and Teachers, to certain Rules; and ſele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted certain Authors to be read onely, as Claſſical, for the Inſtitution of their Youth: And, that it was ſo in the days of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> even in that bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Country of <hi>Gallia,</hi> appeares by <hi>Caeſars</hi> own Commentaries, who tells, how that it was the main Office of thoſe famous men amongſt them cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Druides,</hi> to breed up their Youth not onely in Religion, but alſo to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them in the Nature of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, and mould them with Principles, anſwerable to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>If we reflect upon the two Grand Turns of State in <hi>Rome,</hi> the firſt, from a Monarchy to a <hi>Free-State;</hi> and then from a <hi>Free-State</hi> to a Monarchy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, they miniſter matter of notable Obſervation in this particular.</p>
               <p>In the firſt, we find how difficult it was for the Romans to preſerve their
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:115267:92"/>
                  <hi>Freedom</hi> when they had gotten it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe moſt of the Youth had bin educated in Monarchical Principles, and ſuch Tutors were ever inclining that way upon the leaſt opportunity: ſo that the ſons even of <hi>Brutus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, (who was the Founder of their Liberty) quitted that natural affection which they owed unto their Father, and Councrey; and being ſway'd by the Monarchick Principles of corrupt Education, drew in a great part of the Roman Youth, (like themſelves,) to joyn with them in a Deſign for the bringing back of the <hi>Tarquins</hi> to the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>It is very obſervable alſo, what a do that Common-wealth had to ſettle, ſo long as any of the old ſtock of Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were living, becauſe thoſe corrupt points of Diſcipline and Government, wherewith they were ſeaſoned when young, could not be worn out with Age; but hurried many of them along with the ſtorm of every Inſurrection and Invaſion of the publike Enemy.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, in the Turn of a <hi>Free-State,</hi> to a <hi>Monarchy</hi> again, we ſee with what difficulty <hi>Caeſar</hi> met, in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his own Domination over a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:115267:92"/>
that had been educated in a <hi>Free-State,</hi> and in Principles of <hi>Freedom:</hi> inſomuch, that in the end it coſt him his life being ſtab'd for his Uſurpation by a combination of ſome of the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and the Fact applauded not onely by the People, but by <hi>Cicero,</hi> and all the Roman Writers, and others that had been bred up under the Form of <hi>Freedom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And afterwards, when <hi>Auguſtus</hi> took upon him the Inheritance and Title of his Uncle <hi>Caeſar,</hi> he did it, <hi>lento<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede,</hi> very ſlowly and warily, for fear of conjuring up the ſame ſpirit in the people, that had flown into revenge againſt his Uncle, for his Rape upon their Liberty.</p>
               <p>And it is Noted by <hi>Tacitus,</hi> that among the other advantages that <hi>Auguſtus</hi> had for his Eſtabliſhment, there was this: That he never declared himſelf, till, after many delayes and ſhifts, for the continuation of Power in his own hands, he got inſenſibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Throne, when the old men were moſt of them dead, and the young Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration grown up, having been pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty well educated and inured to his Lordly Domination. The words of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:115267:93"/>
                  <hi>Tacitus</hi> are theſe: All (ſaith he) was quiet in the City, the old names of the Magiſtrates remained unchanged; the young men were all born after <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his Victory at <hi>Actium:</hi> and the greateſt part of the old men, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Civil Wars; when the <hi>Free-State</hi> was imbroiled and uſurpt (in effect, though retained ſtil in name by powerful and ambitious perſons) ſo that when he aſſumed and owned the Empire, there was not one man Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that had ſo much as ſeen the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Form of Government of a <hi>Free-State;</hi> which indeed facilitated his Deſign very much, the Generation then Living, being by his Artifice and Power, bred up to his own Monarchy-Intereſt and Devotion.</p>
               <p>We might be larger, but this is enough, to ſhew of what conſequence the careful Education of Youth, is, in the Conſtitution of Government: and therefore, without doubt, it is one eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential point to be obſerved in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment of a <hi>Free-State,</hi> that all wayes and meanes be uſed for their ſeaſoning and inſtruction in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of <hi>Freedom.</hi>

collected out of the paſt-diſcourſe; the ſence of all ſhall be illuſtrated by one inſtance.</p>
               <p>It is that famous Contention which laſted for three hundred years in <hi>Rome</hi> betwixt the Senate and the People, about the dividing of ſuch Lands as were conquered and taken from the Enemy.</p>
               <p>The Senators; they ſharing the lands amongſt themſelves, allowed little, or none, unto the people; which gave ſuch Diſcontents, that the people made a Law to curb them; enacting, That no Senator ſhould poſſeſs above 500 Acres of Land.</p>
               <p>The Senators cryed, it was againſt their Liberty, thus to be abridged by the people: And the people cryed, it was inconſiſtent with Liberty, that the Senators ſhould thus greaten themſelvs by an ingroſment of wealth and power into their own hands. <hi>Livy</hi> ſaith, The people in this, ſaid right, and the Senators did wrong: but that they both did ill, in making it a ground of Civil Diſſention; for, in proceſs of time, when the <hi>Gracchi,</hi> who were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed great Patrons of Liberty, took upon them to ſide with the people,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:115267:95"/>
they did, inſtead of finding out ſome moderate wayes and Expedients to reduce the Senators to Reaſon, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with ſuch heat and violence, that the Senate being jealous of their own ſafety, were forced to chuſe <hi>Sylla</hi> for their General: which being obſerved by the people, they alſo raiſed an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and made <hi>Marius</hi> their General: ſo that here you ſee in came to a down-right Civil-War.</p>
               <p>The occaſion indeed, was given by the Senators; (for, there was no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they ſhould Grandiſe themſelves in ſo groſs a manner as they did) but yet the occaſion ought not to have bin ſo taken, and proſecuted with ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence as it was by the People: for ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more temperate-wayes had been practiſed by their Anceſtors, and might have been found out again, to curb the Ambition of their Nobility in the Senate: Therefore, the People ought, firſt, to have tryed thoſe wayes again, and have uſed all other means to have brought things about, rather than by a milguided heat and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to ruſh into Arms; which as it is the moſt deſperate Remedy, ſo it ought never to be uſed, but when all

other courſes have been tried in vain, and when the Publick Liberty is really concerned by an imminent Danger, or invincible Neceſſity: For, this Quarrel, which queſtionleſs might have been compoſed was, through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion, made the ground of ſo bloudy a Civil-war, that what through Fines, Baniſhment, inhumane Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, acted on both ſides, Defeats in the open Field, and Maſſacres within the City, it coſt the beſt Bloud and Eſtates of the Nobility and Commons; and in the end, it coſt them alſo their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:115267:96"/>
treaſon by the Law) this was a plain uſurpation, and drew an invincible ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, upon the people, and <hi>Senate,</hi> to arm form their Liberty and commence a Civil war under the conduct of <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey;</hi> ſo that this laſt war was neceſſary as the other was needleſſe, if they could have kept within the bounds of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and moderation.</p>
               <p>We have a very notable inſtance al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in our own Nation, which may ſerue for a Juſt example to all the world in point of behaviour. If we run over the Catalogue of the late Kings defaults in government, we find ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary patience in the people, notwithſtanding his extraordinary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments from time to time. It were needleſs to reckon up the ſeveral Monopolies, Impoſitions, and other oppreſſions of the People, both in ſoul and body, which are made publick and known to all the World; toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with that higheſt of all Practices, not onely in diſſolving Parliaments abruptly, but profeſſedly deſigning the ruine of Parliaments, in depriving the People of their due Succeſſion.

               <p>And ſo by theſe Examples, any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in a State of Freedom, may be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently inſtructed how to demean themſelves, for the avoiding of Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs, Tumult, and Civil Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which are the principal Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences charged by Royaliſts, upon Free-States and Common-wealths: from hence, alſo, may be obſerved all the neceſſary points of prudence, and forbearance, which ought to take place in reſpect of Superiors, till it ſhall evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear unto a people, <hi>that there is a Deſign on foot to ſurprize and ſeize their Liberties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A ſecond Caution, is, in relation to their Elective Power, that in all Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Magiſtrates, they have an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeciall Eye upon the Publick, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king choice of ſuch perſons onely, as have appeared moſt eminent, and active, in the Eſtabliſhment and Love of Freedom.</p>
               <p>In ſuch hands the Guardianſhip of Liberty may be ſafely placed, becauſe ſuch men have made the Publick Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,

and their own, all one; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will neither betray, nor deſert it, in proſperity or adverſity; whereas men of another qualification and temper, if they get into Authority, care not to ſerve the Publick any further, than the publike ſerves them, and will draw off and on as they find their Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity: Yea, and take this for a certain Rule, that if any perſon be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into Power, that loves not the Common-wealth, above all other conſiderations, ſuch a man is (as we ſay) every mans money; any State-Marchant may have him for a Factor: and for good conſideration, he will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten make Returns upon the Publike Intereſt, have a ſtock going in every Party, and with men of every Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and (if occaſion ſerve) truck with the Common-Enemy, and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, both together.</p>

For this, we might give you inſtance enough, and too much; but waving them, it may ſuffice, that moſt of the Broils, Tumults, and Civil Diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that ever hapned in Free-States, have been occaſioned by the Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Treacherous, and Indirect Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſuch perſons admitted into Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, as have not been firm in their hearts to the Intereſt of Liberty.</p>

               <p>The Baniſhment, called <hi>Oſtraoiſm,</hi> among the <hi>Athenians,</hi> was inſtituted (at firſt) upon a juſt and noble ground: ſo was that called <hi>Petatiſm,</hi> among the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> to turn ſuch out of the Common-wealth, who had rendered themſelves ſuſpected againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Liberty: but yet the abuſe of it afterwards proved moſt pernicious, to the imbroyling of thoſe States with Civil Diſſention, whenit was pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome petulant ſpirits, to an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of ſome few (and but few) of

               <p>The Reaſon is, becauſe, (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb ſaith) <hi>Honores mutant mores,</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours change mens manners; Acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and Continuations of Power and

               <p>The Kingdoms of the World, and the Glories of them, are Baites that ſeldome failes when the Tempter goes a fiſhing: and none but he, that was more than man, could have refuſed them. How many Free-States &amp; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths have paid dear for their Experience in this particular? who by truſting their own ſervants too far, have been forced, in the end to receive them for their Maſters.

               <p>And for the clearing of this, it will be requiſite to muſter up thoſe various Particulars that come within the compaſs of Treaſon, according to the Practice, and Opinion of other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The 1. remarkable Treaſon in old <hi>Rome,</hi> after its <hi>Eſtabliſhment in a State of Freedome,</hi> was that of <hi>Brutus</hi> his ſons, who entered into a formal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy for the bringing back of the <hi>Tarquins</hi> to the Kingdom by force of Arms.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Brutus</hi> was the Founder of the Roman Liberty; and therefore one would have thought the young men might have obtained an eaſie pardon: But ſuch was the zeal of the Romans,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:115267:101"/>
for the preſervation of their <hi>Freedom,</hi> that they were all put to death with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mercy; and, that all others in time to come, might be deprived of the leaſt hope of being ſpared upon the like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, their own Father was the man moſt forward to bring them to Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>This was Treaſon in groſs: but in after-time, there ſtarted up more refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned pieces of Treaſon; as may be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected out of the Actions of <hi>Maelius</hi> and <hi>Manlius,</hi> two perſons that had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved highly of the Common wealth; but eſpecially the latter, who ſaved it from ruine, when the <hi>Gauls</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged the Capitol.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, preſuming afterwards upon the People, becauſe of his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Merits, He, by greating him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf beyond the ſize of a good Citizen; and entertaining Thoughts and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of ſurpriſing the Peoples Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, was condemned to death; but yet not without the Peoples pitty (as indeed it was an unhappy Neceſſity, that they ſhould be forced to deſtroy him that had ſaved them from deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction)
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:115267:101"/>
To the ſame end came <hi>Maelius</hi> alſo, upon the like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>Another ſort of Treaſon there was contrived likewiſe againſt that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</p>

               <p>That you may be ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by other Pens then mine; ſuch as the Hiſtorian <hi>Livy, Pomponi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Dionyſius,</hi> and others, that have written of the Roman Affaires and Antiquities.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Some other Particulars alſo, there were, of leſs conſideration, that came within the compaſs of Treaſon; And in all, they were very ſtrict to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Intereſt of the Common-Wealth, without reſpect of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>

               <p>This ſeverity alſo, was retained in the Roman State, where ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came guilty of this Crime, were either burnt alive, or hanged upon a Gibber: Hereupon, (ſaith <hi>Valerius Max. lib.</hi> 2.) when any matter was delivered, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, it was, as if no man had heard a ſyllable of what had been ſaid among ſo many: From whence it came to paſs, that the Decrees of their Senate were called <hi>Tacita,</hi> that is to ſay;

By the Legiſlative Power, we underſtand the Power of making, altering, or repealing Laws, which in all well-ordered Governments, hath ever been lodged in a ſucceſſion of the ſupream Councels of Aſſemblies of a Nation.</p>
               <p>By the Executive Power, we mean that Power which is derived from the other, and by their Authority tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd into the hand or hands of one Perſon, (called a Prince) or into the hands of many (called States) for the adminiſtration of Government, in the Execution of thoſe Laws.

ſome ſhort extraordinary occaſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts the ſafety of a State.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon is evident; becauſe if the Law-makers, (who ever have the Supream Power) ſhould be alſo the conſtant Adminiſtrators and Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of Law and Juſtice, then (by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fequence) the People would be left without Remedy, in caſe of Injuſtice, ſince no Appeal can lie under Heaven againſt ſuch as have the Supremacy; which, if once admitted, were incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the very intent and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral import of true Policy: which ever ſuppoſeth, that men in Power may be unrighteous; and therefore (preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the worſt) points alwayes, in all determinations, at the Enormities and Remedies of Government, on the behalf of the People.</p>
               <p>For the clearing of this, it is worthy your obſervation; that in all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and States whatſoever, where they have had any thing of Freedom among them, the Legiſlative and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive Powers have been managed in diſtinct hands: That is to ſay, the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers have ſet down Laws, as Rules of Government; and then put Power into the hands of others (not their own) to govern by thoſe Rules; by

which means the people were happy, having no Governours, but ſuch as were liable to give an account of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to the ſupream Councel of Law-Makers. And on the other ſide, it is no leſs worthy of a very ſerious obſervation; That Kings and ſtanding States never became abſolute over the People, till they brought both the making and execution of Lawes into their own hands: and as this Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of theirs took place by degrees, ſo unlimited Arbitrary Power crept up into the Throne, there to domineet o're the World, and defie the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the People.</p>

               <p>But what was the conſequence? Nothing but Injuſtice, and Injuſtice without Remedy, till the People were taught by Neceſſity to ordain Lawes, as Rules whereby they ought to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern.
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:115267:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Then began the meeting of the People ſucceſſively in their ſupream Aſſemblies, to make Laws; whereby Kings (in ſuch places as continued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Kingly Form) were limited and reſtrained, ſo that they could do nothing in Government, but what was agreeable to Law; for which they were accountable, as well as other Officers were in other Forms of Government, to thoſe ſupream Councels and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies: Witneſs all the old ſtories of <hi>Athens, Sparta,</hi> and other Countries of <hi>Greece,</hi> where you ſhall find, that the Law-making, and the Law-execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Powers, were placed in diſtinct hands under every Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: For, ſo much of Freedom they retained ſtill under every Form, till they were both ſwallowed up (as they were ſeveral times) by an abſolute Domination.</p>
               <p>In old <hi>Rome,</hi> we find <hi>Romulus</hi> their firſt King cut in pieces by the Senate, for taking upon him to make and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Laws at his own pleaſure.

               <p>Afterwards, their Emperors (though Uſurpers) durſt not at firſt turn both theſe Powers into the Channel of their own unbounded Will; but did it by degrees, that they might the more infenſibly deprive the people of their Liberty, till at length they openly made and executed Laws at their own

               <p>There is a notable faction we read of in this <hi>Roman</hi> ſtory, which was that of the <hi>Decemviri,</hi> who being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the Government, and the time of their truſt expired, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of making a Reſignation, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined together for the Perpetuation of

               <p>If we conſider alſo what befell <hi>Carthage,</hi> and how it came to ruine: the ſtory tells us, it was occaſioned by their Factions, the whole Senate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divided betwixt two potent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of <hi>Hannibal</hi> and <hi>Hanno;</hi> by which means they were diſinabled, from carrying on their Warre with Unanimity and alacrity, as was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite

               <p>It was the ſame Devil of Faction, and Civil Diſſention, (<hi>as Philip de Comines</hi> tells us) that made way for the Turk into <hi>Hungaria,</hi> as it let him in before into <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> that admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> into <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy;</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> into <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> firſt under <hi>Pompey;</hi> and afterwards un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Veſpatian</hi> and <hi>Titus.</hi>

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:115267:119"/>
in a Prince it is to keep his Word, and live with Integrity, not making uſe of Cunning and Subtilty, every one knows well: yet we ſee by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in theſe our dayes, that thoſe Princes have effected great matters, who have made ſmall reckoning of keeping their words, and have known by their Craft, how to turn and wind men about, and in the end overcome thoſe who have grounded upon the Truth.</p>
               <p>You muſt then know, there are two kinds of Combating or Fighting: the one, by Right of the Laws: the other, meerly by Force. That firſt way is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to Men: The other is alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to Beaſts. But becauſe the firſt many times ſuffices not, there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to make recourſe to the ſecond: wherefore, it behoves a Prince to know how to make good uſe of that part which belongs to a Beaſt, as well as that which is proper to a Man.</p>
               <p>This part hath been covertly ſhew'd to Princes by antient Writers; who ſay, that <hi>Achilles,</hi> and many others of thoſe antient Princes, were intruſted to <hi>Chiron</hi> the <hi>Centaure,</hi> to be brought up under his Diſcipline: The morall
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:115267:120"/>
of this, having for their Teacher, one that was half a Beaſt, and half a Man, was nothing elſe, but that it was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for a Prince to underſtand how to make his advantage of the one, and other Nature, becauſe neither could ſubſiſt without the other.</p>
               <p>A Prince then being neceſſitated to know how to make uſe of that part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to a Beaſt, ought to ſerve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the Conditions of the Fox, and the Lyon; for the Lyon cannot keep himſelf from Snares, nor the Fox de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelf againſt the Wolves. He had need then be a Fox, that he may beware of the Snares; and a Lyon, that he may ſcare the Wolves. Thoſe that ſtand wholly upon the Lyon, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not themſelves.</p>
               <p>And therefore a wiſe Prince cannot, nor ought not to keep his Faith gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, when the obſervance thereof turnes to diſadvantage, and the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that made him promiſe, are paſt: for if men were all good, this Rule would not be allowable; but being they are full of miſchief, and will not make it good to thee, neither art thou tied to keep it with them: nor ſhall a Prince ever want lawfull occaſions to
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:115267:120"/>
give colour to this breach. Very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny modern Examples hereof might be alleadged, wherein might be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how many Peaces concluded, and how many Promiſes made, have been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>olated and broken by Infidelity of Princes: and ordinarily things have beſt ſucceeded with him that hath bin neareſt the Fox in condition.</p>
               <p>But it is neceſſary to underſtand, how to ſet a good colour upon this Diſpoſition, and be able to feign and diſſemble throughly; and men are ſo ſimple, and yield ſo much to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Neceſſities, that he who hath a mind to deceive, ſhall alwayes find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother that will be deceived. I will not conceal any of the Examples that have been of late; <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixth never did any thing elſe, than deceive men, and never meant otherwiſe, and always found whom to work upon; yet never was there man that would proteſt more effectually, nor aver any thing with more ſolemn Oaths, and obſerve them leſs then he: never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, his Couzenage thrived well with him, for he knew how to play his part cunningly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:115267:121"/>Therefore is there no neceſſitie for a Prince to be endued with all thoſe above written qualities, but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves well that he ſeeme to be ſo: or rather I will boldly ſay this, that hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe qualities, and alwaies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating himſelf by them, they are hurtfull; but ſeeming to have them, they are advantageous, as to ſeeme pittyfull, faithfull, milde, religious, and indeed to be ſo (provided with all thou beeſt of ſuch a compoſition, that if need require thee to uſe the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, thou canſt, and know'ſt how to apply thy ſelfe thereto.) And it ſuffices to conceive this, that a Prince, and eſpecially a new Prince, cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve all theſe things, for which men are held good, he being often forced, for the maintenance of his State, to do contrary to his faith, charity, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, and religion. And therefore it behoves him to have a mind ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as to turn and take the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of all winds and fortunes; and as formerly I ſaid, not forſake the good while he can; but to know to make uſe of the evil upon neceſſity. A prince then ought to have a ſpeciall care, that he never let fall any words, but what
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:115267:121"/>
are all ſeaſoned with the five above written qualities: and let him ſeem to him that ſees and knows him, all pitty, all faith, all integrity, all humanity, all religion; not is there any thing more neceſſarie for him to ſeem to have, than the laſt quality: for all men in generall judge thereof, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the ſight than by the touch; for every man, may come to the ſight of him, few come to the touch and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him; every man may come to ſee what thou ſeemeſt; few come to underſtand and perceive what thou art: and thoſe few dare not oppoſe the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of many, who have the Majeſty of ſtate to protect them. And in all mens actions, eſpecially thoſe of Princes, wherein there is no judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to appeal unto, men forbear to give their cenſures till the events, and ends of thing. Let a Prince therefore take the ſureſt courſes he can to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his life and ſtate, the meanes ſhall alwaies be thought honorable, and commended by every one: for the vulgar is ever taken with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance and event of a thing, and for the moſt part of the people, they are but the vulgar, the others that are
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:115267:122"/>
but few, take place where the vulgar have no ſubſſiſtance. A Prince there is in theſe daies, whom I ſhall not do well to name, that preaches nothing but peace and faith, but had he kept the one and the other, ſeverall times had they taken from him his State and reputation.</p>
               <p>This is the old Court Goſpel, which hath gained many thouſand of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes, among the great ones, from time to time, and the inferences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing thence in behalfe of the people, in breife are theſe: That ſince the great ones of the world, have been very few that have avoyded this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, therefore it concerns the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to keep a ſtrict hand and eie upon them all, and impoſe not overmuch or long confidence in any.</p>
               <p>If the Right of laws be the way of men, and force of beaſts and great ones, not onely adviſed, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to the latter, then it concernes any Nation or people to ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and keep Great men from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generating into beaſts, by holding up of law, liberty, priviledge, birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, elective power, againſt the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:115267:122"/>
ignoble beaſtly way of powerfull do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</p>
               <p>If of all beaſts, a Prince ſhould ſome times reſemble the Lyon, and ſomtimes the Fox, then people ought to obſerve great ones in both the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes, and be ſure to cage the Lyon, and unkennel the Fox, and never leave till they have ſtript the one, and unrais'd the other.</p>
               <p>If a Prince cannot, and ought not to keep his faith given, when the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance thereof turnes to diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and the occaſions that made him promiſe, are paſt; then it is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the people, never to truſt any Princes, nor ingagements and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of men in power, but ever to preſerve a power within themſelves, either to reject them, or to hold them to the performance whether they will or no. And if Princes ſhall never want occaſions to give colour to this breach, then alſo it concernes the people, ever to make ſure of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and not ſuffer themſelves to be deluded with colours, ſhadows, and meere pretences.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if it be neceſſarie for great ones to fain and diſſemble throughly;
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:115267:123"/>
becauſe men are ſo ſimple and yield ſo much to the preſent neceſſity (as <hi>Machivel</hi> ſaith;) and in regard he that hath a mind to deceive, ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes finde another that will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: then it concerns any people or Nation, to make a narrow ſearch ever into the men, and their preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and neceſſities, whether they be fained or not; and if they diſcover a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deceipt hath been uſed, then they deſerve to be ſlaves, that will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any longer. Thus I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the prime Errors of Government, and Rules of Policy. I ſhall now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with a word of Advice, in order to the chuſing of the Supreme Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.</p>
               <p>Since it appears, that the right, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, welfare, and ſafety of a people, conſiſts in a due ſucceſſion of their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Aſſemblies: ſurely then, the right conſtitution and orderly moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them, is of the greateſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that can be, there being ſo much imbarqued in this Veſſel, that if it ſhould miſcarry, all is irreparably loſt, unleſs it can be recovered again out of the Sea of confuſion. Therefore, as at all times there ought to be an
